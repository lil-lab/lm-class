4330,The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .
4331,... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .
4332,"Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?"
4333,It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) .
4334,This action-thriller\/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .
4335,MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .

4361,"Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter ."
4362,The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
4363,The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
4364,"Average , at best , I 'm afraid ."

4398,Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .
4399,Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .
4400,None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .

4429,"In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting ."
4430,The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .
4431,Uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ...
4432,"Large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride ."

4436,"Instead of making his own style , director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture"
4437,Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama .
4438,A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .
4439,A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
4440,It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
4441,Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .
4442,Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .

4444,Horrible .
4445,The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do .

4461,It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard ( Eileen Walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .

4485,What 's missing is what we call the ` wow ' factor .
4486,The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard ( which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog ) is that it 's not as obnoxious as Tom Green 's Freddie Got Fingered .
4487,"... Tara Reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the Miss Hawaiian Tropic Pageant , so I do n't know what she 's doing in here ..."

4490,"It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure ."
4491,This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
