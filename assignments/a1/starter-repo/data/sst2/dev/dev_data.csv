843,"Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle ."
844,This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
845,"The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle ."
846,"It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up ."
847,The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
848,At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
849,"A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers ."
850,The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
851,The end result is a film that 's neither .
852,Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
853,Something like scrubbing the toilet .
854,Or emptying rat traps .
855,Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .
856,Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .
857,"\/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff \/ Fred thinks he 's tough \/ And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !"
858,"Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?"
859,There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
860,"However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust ."
861,"The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original ."
862,But it could have been worse .
863,"Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny ."
864,Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
865,"comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class ."
866,"... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns ."
867,it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
868,"It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface ."
869,"The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well ."
870,"Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character ."
