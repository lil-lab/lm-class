Social Security and spending for poor people are exempted
However the Associated Press 's account of the Monday sequester order signed by President Bush neatly captured the contempt Congress shows toward the notion of a legally binding commitment
Lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficit cutting bill
Mr. Darman 's inclination to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
There is some feeling here that the cuts are the way to go
It will reduce spending in a very effective fashion
This attitude is being waved away by sophisticates around Washington as little more than tough talk
It looks to us like a golden opportunity for George Bush to chop off at the knees all this talk about a timid unserious presidency
Mr. Bush would be acting in the public interest if he let the Washington elites who manipulate these budgets the bureaucrats the lobbyists the congressional staffers live for just one year on a restricted diet
Ask Tommy Lasorda thin is in
Another major factor in this positive trend was Ronald Reagan 's decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than raising taxes
George Bush 's continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring Congress to make choices among competing priorities rather than just saying yes to all the grateful special interest constituencies that fill the PAC trough
If Washington 's elites ever succeed in bursting the tax dam Americans will be engulfed in a red sea of new spending programs such as federalized child care
Child care was one of the many extraneous bills pulled out of the Senate 's reconciliation bill last Friday
Others were the capital gains cut Section eighty nine repeal the disabled workers bill and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act
All this stuff still is in the House 's one thousand eight hundred seventy eight page reconciliation bill and many Members say they 're reluctant to pull out cherished bills just to see them die
Republicans especially want a guarantee from the House leadership that they 'll get an up or down vote on the bills
House Speaker Foley ought to deliver that promise
This is the way government is supposed to work with politicians taking responsibility for votes that their constituents can identify instead of concealing them in the great reconciliation garbage truck
Those days are gone
Nor do we see any reason to believe that a metropolitan Washington that has gotten fat and rich and lazy in the shadow of the federal colossus will change much on its own initiative
Save the sequester and let Washington scream

Japanese domestic institutions including trust banks and investment management firms that had been on the sidelines during Monday 's fall were back in the market analysts said
Foreign investors reportedly started off selling but later joined in the buying
The Tokyo rally seemed to confirm the view frequently expressed in Japan in the past few days that the drop in New York was a local problem related to merger and acquisition activity in the U. S.
This time we do n't really have to worry about Tokyo said an official at Daiwa Securities Co
Nothing has changed fundamentally in the Tokyo market
But even though Tokyo appears unharmed by recent market volatility analysts and traders say there are still a few concerns on the horizon
In particular Japanese investors will be keeping a wary eye on Wall Street to see whether Monday 's eighty eight point one two point rally holds up as fresh U. S. economic data are released
People are placing small bets
There 's no huge buying said Stephen Hill head of equity sales at Jardine Fleming Securities Limited in Tokyo
Really brave views right now would be foolhardy
Yesterday 's buyers favored real estate construction and other large capitalization issues reflecting the fact that many Tokyo investors now feel safer with domestically oriented stocks analysts said
They also are concerned about the persistent strength of the dollar against the yen as a weaker yen leads to higher import prices in Japan and adds to domestic inflationary pressures
Currency concerns also weigh heavily on interest rate sensitive stocks such as banking and other financial issues because of fears that Japanese interest rates might have to rise to keep the dollar in check

THE STOCK of Applied Power Incorporated which split two for one in May has risen since August nineteen eighty eight
In yesterday 's edition it was incorrectly stated that the company 's share price has softened since August nineteen eighty eight
The stock market 's dizzying gyrations during the past few days have made a lot of individual investors wish they could buy some sort of insurance
After all they wo n't soon forget the stock bargains that became available after the October nineteen eighty seven crash
But while they want to be on the alert for similar buying opportunities now they 're afraid of being hammered by another terrifying plunge
The solution at least for some investors may be a hedging technique that 's well known to players in the stock options market
Called a married put the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock
It 's like fire insurance says Harrison Roth the senior options strategist at Cowen & Co
But most investment advisers do n't recommend using married puts all the time
That 's because the cost of buying put options eats into an investor 's profit when stock prices rise
This is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire says Mr. Roth
You always want your house insured but you do n't always feel the need for your investments to be insured
In addition to hedging new stock purchases the married put technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns
In either case the investor faces three possible outcomes
If the stock goes up in price between now and the put 's expiration date the put will probably expire worthless
The investor will be out the cost of the put which is called the premium and this loss will reduce the stock market profit
The worst case scenario would be if the put expires worthless
If the price of the stock declines the put will increase in value
Once the stock price is less than the exercise price or strike price of the put the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar
The put establishes a minimum selling price for the stock during its life
When a stock falls below the put 's strike price the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit
Or the investor can exercise the put by tendering the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who has sold a put on the same stock
Brokers handle such transactions through the Options Clearing Corporation which guarantees all option trades
The accompanying table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks
Though not reflected in the table an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset by any dividends that the stock pays
For example Tenneco Incorporated pays a quarterly dividend of seventy six cents which would be received before the February option expires and thus reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount
In this case the investor 's risk would n't exceed three point six percent of the total investment
To simplify the calculations commissions on the option and underlying stock are n't included in the table
There are more than six hundred fifty stocks on which options may be bought and sold including some over the counter stocks
But some investors might prefer a simpler strategy then hedging their individual holdings
They can do this by purchasing index puts which are simply put options on indexes that match broad baskets of stocks
For instance the most popular index option is the S. & P. one hundred option commonly called the O. E. X.
It is based on the stocks that make up Standard & Poor 's one hundred stock index
Unlike options on individual issues index options are settled only in cash and no stock is ever tendered
But while index options are convenient they have several disadvantages
For one thing an investor 's portfolio might not closely match the S. & P. one hundred
As a result the O. E. X. insurance may or may not fully protect an investor 's holdings in the event of a market decline
In addition O. E. X. options were suspended from trading last Friday afternoon after the stock market sell off got under way and trading in the S. & P. five hundred futures contract was halted
So an investor who wanted to realize a profit on O. E. X. puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck
On the other hand only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on Friday
Normally once the underlying investment is suspended from trading the options on those investments also do n't trade
Ultimately whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options
That cost rises in times of high market volatility
But it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit
The protection from using married puts is clearly superior to that afforded by another options strategy some investors consider using during troubled times selling call options on stocks the investor owns
A call option is similar to a put except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration
Selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock market decline
That 's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call
But if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option the stock is almost certain to be called away
And in that case the investor misses out on any major upside gain
These calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock
All prices are as of Monday 's close
Hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the House version in advance of a House Senate conference broke down
But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues ranging from cutting the capital gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic illness insurance
Many members feel there are important features of the House bill that should be enacted Speaker Thomas Foley D. Wash said
If there is any support for reducing the bill it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form
Now those items will be discussed in a House Senate conference which could begin as soon as today with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation
You 've got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta D. Calif
This is a democratic process you ca n't slam dunk anything around here
White House Budget Director Richard Darman has said he would continue to press to keep the capital gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the House drops many of its costly provisions
Senate leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to President Bush by the end of the week but Speaker Foley said that was n't likely
Failure to pass the bill meant that sixteen point one billion dollars in across the board spending cuts took effect Monday under the Gramm Rudman budget law
The bill must be enacted before the cuts can be restored

A surprising surge in the U. S. trade deficit raised fears that the nation 's export drive has stalled and caused new turmoil in financial markets
The merchandise trade deficit widened in August to ten point seven seven billion dollars the Commerce Department reported a sharp deterioration from July 's eight point two four billion dollars and the largest deficit of any month this year
Exports fell for the second month in a row while imports rose to a record
This is one of the worst trade releases we 've had since the dollar troughed out in nineteen eighty seven said Geoffrey Dennis chief international economist at James Capel Incorporated
The number had a troubling effect on Wall Street suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may underlie last Friday 's stock market slide
The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than sixty points after the report 's release before recovering to close eighteen point six five points lower at two thousand six hundred thirty eight point seven three
This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline said Norman Robertson chief economist for Mellon Bank
It raises questions about more deep seated problems the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them
The trade report drew yet another unsettling parallel to October nineteen eighty seven
On October fourteenth of that year the announcement of an unusually large August trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline
The slide continued until the record five hundred eight point market drop on October nineteenth
In nineteen eighty seven however the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade while the current report comes after a period of improvement
The bleak trade report was played down by the Bush administration
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called the worsening trade figures disappointing after two very good months
And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the deficit was an unwelcome increase adding that we 're hopeful that it simply is a one month situation and will turn around
But the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the U. S. trade deficit has run out of steam
That 's still an improvement over last year but it leads one to conclude that basically we 've gotten all the mileage we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit
Exports declined for the second consecutive month in August slipping zero point two percent to thirty point four one billion dollars the Commerce Department reported
Imports on the other hand leaped six point four percent to a record forty one point one eight billion dollars
Not only was August 's deficit far worse than July 's but the government revised the July figure substantially from the seven point five eight billion dollars deficit it had initially reported last month
Many economists contend that deep cuts in the U. S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur
That 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export
People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem said Mr. Robertson
In addition the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U. S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness
Since March exports have been virtually flat
At the same time William T. Archey international vice president at the U. S. Chamber of Commerce notes Clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more attractive by causing their prices to decline
Most economists expect the slowing U. S. economy to curb demand for imports
But they foresee little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal budget deficit come down
That must start with cutting the federal budget deficit
August 's decline in exports reflected decreases in sales of industrial supplies capital goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles parts and engines
The jump in imports stemmed from across the board increases in purchases of foreign goods
The numbers were adjusted for usual seasonal fluctuations

Steve Jobs took a step back from the frontier of personal computer technology in an effort to spur sales of Next Incorporated 's new machine
The hard drive which is the storage device of choice for virtually every desktop computer user also now will supplement Next 's futuristic optical device if buyers pay full price
Mr. Jobs co founder of Apple Computer Incorporated founded Next four years ago in the hopes of fomenting a revolution in the way desktop computers are designed and used
His Next computer introduced about a year ago and aimed primarily at university computer users sports snazzy graphics digital sound built in networking and a sleek black design
But the computer was proving a hard sell because of its high price a lack of software and an optical data storage device that was too slow
The machine began shipping at the end of last year
The closely held company has n't disclosed sales
However most universities that have bought the machines say they are buying small numbers for evaluation purposes
Universities can now buy a Next computer without an optical storage device for four thousand nine hundred ninety five dollars
Commercial customers can purchase the same system through Businessland Incorporated a computer retailer based in San Jose California for roughly three thousand dollars more
Mr. Jobs said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device which is n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals
Another factor was that customers were asking Why do n't you give us a cheaper system Mr. Jobs said at a conference on university computing here
Optical storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer
But the technology while reliable is far slower than the widely used hard drives
To get around the delays caused by the optical device Businessland which is Next 's exclusive dealer to corporations has for months been advising customers to purchase hard drives with the machines
We 're extremely committed to optical storage technology he said
We think everything will go this way in a few years
He said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices
But university computer specialists who welcomed the move called it a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that 's likely to increase Next 's sales on campuses
From the standpoint of being on the forefront of technology this is a step backward said Jerry W. Sprecher a senior computing manager for the California state university system
But it will definitely boost Next 's sales
Universities however say Next 's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine
We 'd still like to see a student model priced at about three thousand five hundred dollars said Ronald Johnson director of academic computing at Minnesota 's Gustavus Adolphus College which has bought eight Next machines
Broad acceptance of Next 's computer also is hindered by difficulty in distributing software for it
Most software is distributed on cheap floppy disks but the Next computer does n't come with a device that reads them
Next 's computer also needs more software applications but Mr. Jobs said he expects more soon
He said he expects Lotus Development Corporation to introduce a Next version of its popular one two three spreadsheet program in nineteen ninety
Educators added that Next needs to soon offer a color version of its computer
Every major maker offers computers with color displays
Next wo n't comment on when it will do the same but is believed to have a color model under development

Ashton Tate Corporation reported a net loss of nineteen point four million dollars or seventy four cents a share for the third quarter which was burdened by severance costs and the expense of upgrading its database software inventories
The software company said revenue slid twenty eight percent to fifty three point nine million dollars
This contrasts with the year ago quarter when the company had net income of eleven point seven million dollars or forty five cents a share on revenue of seventy five point seven million dollars
For the nine months Ashton Tate had a loss of twenty seven point six million dollars or one dollar and five cents a share
In the year ago period the company had profit of thirty four point three million dollars or one dollar and thirty two cents a share
Revenue in the period slid almost eight percent to two hundred three point two million dollars from about two hundred twenty million dollars last year
He said the company was encouraged by feedback it received from selected customers now testing Version one point one
The red ink came as no surprise to Wall Street but analysts said they saw ominous hints of a further delay in volume shipments of Version one point one a harbinger of continued losses in the fourth quarter
The loss is in line with our expectations said John C. Maxwell the Third an analyst with Dillon Read & Company in New York
He added gross margins and operating profit eroded quite dramatically from the prior quarter along with sales of existing software product lines like Multimate and Framework
The success of a new product in the database line is needed
And while the company has n't made a definite statement it now looks like that 's not going to be anytime soon Mr. Maxwell said
The company said in a statement that it expects to ship new products during the next two quarters
It now looks like database Four Version one point one is n't going to be widely available until the first quarter of nineteen ninety said David Bayer an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco
This is the second delay now in getting the product out the door
It does prolong the pain somewhat
Mr. Maxwell said unless the company can start shipments of the new product sometime this quarter the fourth quarter loss is likely to be comparable to the third quarter 's
If the company can start to ship during this quarter it could stem some if not all of the red ink he said

Prospect Group Incorporated whose recent hostile tender offer for Recognition Equipment Incorporated failed for lack of financing apparently has gained a measure of control over the troubled company anyway
As part of what a Recognition spokeswoman termed an amiable agreement Prospect Group will wind up with control of top management posts and an increased stake in the maker of data management equipment
In a management restructuring Thomas L. Ringer resigned as chairman chief executive and a director while Israel Sheinberg resigned as a director
Mr. Sheinberg remains as executive vice president
Thomas M. Hurley and Robert A. Vanourek who had been designated to take over Recognition 's top spots had Prospect 's tender offer succeeded were named co chief executives and directors
Mr. Hurley was formerly a vice president and general manager of an Avery International division Mr. Vanourek was a former group vice president of Pitney Bowes Incorporated
In addition the agreement calls for Gilbert H. Lamphere chairman of Prospect Group 's executive committee to be named chairman of a restructured board that will include four new independent directors
Also named to the revised board was Thomas A. Loose Recognition 's senior vice president and general counsel
Prospect a New York based leveraged buy out firm also agreed to invest fifteen million dollars in Recognition which in turn agreed to repurchase as much as twenty million dollars of its stock
That would increase Prospect 's ownership of the company 's fully diluted shares outstanding to twenty percent from fourteen point one percent
Under the agreement Prospect is permitted to increase its stake in Recognition to thirty percent
In August Recognition said it was in violation of certain terms of its debt agreements with bank lenders because of a three point nine million dollars loss for the third quarter ended July thirty first
The company attributed the loss to declining revenue and litigation costs relating to criminal charges against the company and two former executives William G. Moore Junior and Robert W. Reedy

Recognition Equipment said it expected to put the agreement with Prospect to a vote of its stockholders at a special meeting in January

General Motors Corporation 's Chevrolet division reacting to slow sales said it will offer eight hundred dollars rebates on its nineteen ninety Beretta the two door version of its core compact car line
Sluggish sales of the Beretta and its four door sister car the Corsica prompted G. M. to idle the two plants that build the automobiles for a total of three weeks this month
The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest volume car line at Chevrolet but sales of the vehicles are off nine point six percent for the year and fell a steep thirty four percent during early October
Chevrolet already is offering an eight hundred dollars rebate on the nineteen ninety model Corsica
The latest rebate is good for all Beretta models
Chevrolet buyers can take the rebate or get discount financing at rates ranging from six point nine percent on twenty four month loans to ten point nine percent on sixty month loans
StatesWest Airlines said it submitted an offer to the directors of Mesa Airlines to acquire the Farmington N. M. carrier
Except to characterize its offer as fair and generous and in the best interests of Mesa shareholders StatesWest declined to discuss details of its proposal
It also asked Mesa to keep the proposal confidential
A Mesa official confirmed receipt of the offer and said directors would meet to consider it
Last week Mesa rejected a proposal by StatesWest to acquire it or merge
StatesWest has a seven point two five percent stake in Mesa which operates twenty twin engine and two single engine turboprops among forty two cities in New Mexico Arizona Wyoming Colorado and Texas

The former president of FirstSouth F. A. a defunct Arkansas thrift pleaded guilty to conspiring to inflate the institution 's earnings by concealing worthless loan guarantees
Roderick D. Reed the Third who was also chief operating officer of FirstSouth could receive a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison and a two hundred fifty thousand dollars fine
A sentencing date has n't been set
Mr. Reed admitted he conspired to conceal an agreement not to enforce loan guarantees executed by Dallas real estate developers A. Starke Taylor the Third and George S. Watson both of whom were FirstSouth stockholders
Neither Mr. Taylor nor Mr. Watson have been charged with criminal wrongdoing
The conspiracy was part of an effort by Mr. Reed to hide FirstSouth 's shaky financial condition from federal regulators according to federal prosecutors and regulators
The one point six eight billion dollars thrift was declared insolvent and closed in December nineteen eighty six
FirstSouth 's former chairman and chief executive officer Howard Weichern is also charged with conspiring to conceal the agreements with Messrs. Watson and Taylor
Mr. Weichern is scheduled for trial January third before federal Judge Stephen Reasoner of Little Rock
I approached Mastergate Larry Gelbart 's new comedy at the Criterion Center with considerable trepidation
Nothing I assumed would be more hopelessly dated than a political satire on the Iran Contra affair
I had underestimated however both Mr. Gelbart 's wit and the persistence of scandal in Washington
Though the play clearly is framed around the events of Iran Contra it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over the past thirty years
Onstage a congressional hearing is in progress complete with elegant crystal chandelier overhead and a lifesize reproduction of the signing of the Constitution in the background
The witness table is center stage and below it the paraphernalia for the ever present media in this case T. N. N. the Total News Network
Not only are there camera operators on all sides but the proceedings are shown on monitors throughout the theater
The metaphor of theater is not entirely coincidental
Mr. Gelbart clearly feels that all the participants in a congressional hearing the witnesses the lawyers the interrogators and the news media are performers
As the story of Mastergate unfolds we learn that the Internal Revenue Service confiscated one of the properties of a foreign financier who owes the government millions in taxes
The man it seems has a Lichtenstein corporation licensed in Libya and sheltered in the Bahamas
He himself lives in a consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in Switzerland
The property seized by the I. R. S. is a Hollywood film studio Master Pictures Incorporated M. P. I.
The lowly agent Abel Lamb who as you might guess is being led to the slaughter is ordered to take over the studio
Soon the studio is producing a forty million dollars picture called Tet the Motion Picture to distinguish it from Tet the Offensive as well as Tet the Book and Tet the Album
The man handling all this for the now deceased Slaughter is Major Manley Battle Mr. Gelbart 's stand in for Colonel Oliver North
Director Michael Engler has assembled a top flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings
Mr. Gelbart also has fun with language
Mastergate is subtitled a play on words and Mr. Gelbart plays that game as well as anyone
He describes a Mastergate flunky as one who experienced a meteoric disappearance and found himself handling blanket appeals at the Bureau of Indian Affairs
This interest in words goes beyond puns and playfulness however
Mr. Gelbart deplores the obfuscation the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides
As the hearings begin the self important Senator Bowman Jerome Kilty announces Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape
At another point he intones Publicity is a small price to pay for secrecy
The evening is short ninety five minutes without an intermission but even so as the play progresses the thrust of Mr. Gelbart 's satire loses its sharpness as his targets pop up ever more predictably
Most of the evening though is filled with rare and welcome wit
In Mastergate Mr. Gelbart has provided us not just one but two commodities that have all but disappeared from the Broadway theater sharp political satire and an even sharper appreciation of the value of language
The Federal National Mortgage Association set up a three member office of the chairman and elected James A. Johnson as vice chairman effective January first
Mr. Johnson has been a managing director at Shearson Lehman Hutton since nineteen eighty five and before that was president of Public Strategies a Washington consulting firm
He is well known in Democratic circles having been executive assistant to Vice President Walter Mondale and chairman of Mr. Mondale 's nineteen eighty four presidential campaign
At Fannie Mae he will take responsibility for the corporation 's financial and legal areas and will work with David Maxwell chairman and chief executive officer and Roger Birk president and chief operating officer on strategic planning
Mr. Johnson forty five years old has been a consultant on strategy to Fannie Mae for the past three and a half years
In an interview he said Fannie Mae faces a number of challenges with the restructuring of the thrift industry and the push to broaden its activities overseas
There 's no shortage of major things to do he said
Fannie Mae also said James A. Aliber chairman of First Federal of Michigan and a director since nineteen eighty five moved up the date of his retirement from the board to accommodate Mr. Johnson 's election as a director
The board has thirteen members elected by holders and five presidential appointees
Fannie Mae a federally chartered shareholder owned corporation operates a secondary market for mortgage loans buying loans from lenders packaging some into securities for sale to investors and keeping the rest in its portfolio
Its many lively stories include the Gutfreund Postel holiday cheer imbroglio
These two New Crowd families lived in the same apartment building with the Postel penthouse perched on top of the Gutfreund duplex
The penthouse elevator started up from the Gutfreund landing and Susan Gutfreund used to turn off its light to give the impression that there was no higher floor
Eventually Mr. Postel broke his toe in the dark
Then the Gutfreunds determined to put up a twenty two foot Christmas tree weighing a quarter of a ton to amaze their holiday guests
For this a crane needed to be mounted on the Postels ' terrace
The Postels did not give permission
But the Gutfreund workers went ahead anyway only to be captured in flagrante by Joan Postel who called the police
Nothing less it seemed could console them for their traumas
Where had all the money come from
The young John Gutfreund had been discovered by Billy Salomon of Salomon Brothers when he was still a bearded liberal and put to work as a trader and then as a rough and tumble syndicator
Get off your he would bellow say the authors
Rising in the firm he became powerful and bland though his new wife Susan made him shine in the gossip columns with her profligate spending habits and flamboyant frocks
After he had been head of the company for three and a half years he and his partners sold it to Phibro a powerful commodity trading outfit for five hundred fifty million dollars in Phibro stock
Limited partner Billy Salomon whose family name had been on the firm 's door for seventy years and who had hoped it would be there forever was not consulted
Mr. Gutfreund collected thirty two million dollars while Billy Salomon got ten million dollars much less than if he had conducted the sale
I felt betrayed he later said
Worse Salomon 's timing had been off
Its profits unlike Phibro 's soared over the next two years and had it held out Salomon could have gotten an even bigger bundle
The book also recounts the not dissimilar maneuvers surrounding the changing of the guard at Lehman Brothers and other grand old firms
The earlier generation of our crowd bankers Belmonts Warburgs Lehmans Baches and Schiffs had stressed above all probity tradition continuity and reputation
They were old fashioned elegant gentlemen who happened to be of German Jewish extraction
But in the harsh world of today 's Wall Street they have lost out to more aggressive and sometimes less scrupulous successors
The cuckoo prefers the nests of other birds and heaves out their eggs
But the old guard hired the New Crowd people It brought in its own cuckoos
So as the Old Crowd toppled from the branch it should n't have been too surprised
The old guard had every right however to disdain the newcomers ' new ways of making money such as greenmail
A Fortune article on Saul Steinberg was entitled Fear and Loathing in the Corporate Boardrooms
Their other staple has been corporate takeovers often hostile and financed by junk bonds
Hostile takeovers are quite a new phenomenon
Sometimes they are constructive but often not
First by making management focus on short term results they inhibit building for the future just the opposite of Japan
Second a long term shareholder of a good company need n't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily It will bounce back
But if a raider takes over when the stock is weak the shareholder never gets his recovery
The raiders meanwhile have evolved their own pattern for spending their new millions
As described in The New Crowd they take on ambitious new wives move to Greenwich Connecticut or Bedford N. Y. buy O. K. pictures and let their wives share the wealth with decorators
Having donated heavily to museums they demand a place on their boards
The book is patronizing about this nouveau riche struggle for respectability which has its tawdry aspects
However on balance the charity game helps America
If those who have the money do n't get involved with the museums and the charities then City Hall will do it badly
It has been rightly observed that the main thing wrong with tainted money is t' ai nt enough of it
A handful of the New Crowd operators have crossed the line from the immoral to the illegal and have ended up in the slammer or paying huge fines
Ivan Boesky Dennis Levine Martin Siegel Victor and Steven Posner and now Michael Milken and perhaps Leona Helmsley
The glitzy office that Ivan Boesky vacated for a prison cell had previously contained commodity operators Marc Rich and Pinky Green today fugitives from a potential century apiece of jail sentences
The Old Crowd is deeply concerned by the backlash from all this
However the phenomenon is not specifically Jewish
It has always been true that those outside the club want to climb in and that a few will cut corners in the process
Some pretty seamy stuff built the turn of the century families ' Fifth Avenue and Newport palazzi and endowed their daughters ' weddings to foreign noblemen
Mr. Boesky was a piker compared to Jay Gould and Jim Fiske and Commodore Vanderbilt thought nothing of bribing judges and legislators
So who knows
In a generation or two some of the New Crowd may attain true respectability perhaps to be displaced in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous raptors
Or perhaps Wall Street when it has suffered enough will realize that finance is a service industry and change its ethos
Mr. Train is president of Train Smith Investment Counsel New York
Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons said he raised his stake in Lockheed Corporation to ten point six two percent from ten point four three percent of the aerospace and electronics concern 's common shares
They include one hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred shares bought Friday for between forty seven point one two five and forty eight dollars each
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Lockheed closed at forty six point one two five dollars a share down twelve point five cents

Valhi said the articles did n't accurately reflect Valhi and its affiliates ' intentions toward Lockheed
Instead Valhi said they may increase decrease or retain their Lockheed holdings depending on a number of conditions

How soon Wang will stage a comeback or if it will at all are still matters of debate
But Wang salespeople are trying to cope with the biggest challenge any marketer can face selling the products of a company that is on the ropes
It can happen in any industry
Consider the difficulties faced by Audi salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration or Exxon dealers ' problems in the wake of the Valdez oil spill
Like thousands of salespeople before them Wang 's are finding ways to combat the bad news
Wang got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts
Its mainline minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers
Last year it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising
Salespeople try to push their products and avoid discussions of finances
Responding to such questions is defensive says Kenneth Olissa Wang 's vice president marketing
That 's antithetical to the art of selling
Moreover he notes that analyzing financial results poses a problem for a salesman who is n't particularly familiar with a balance sheet
At one sales strategy meeting an executive suggested ordering salespeople to become experts on the annual report
Mr. Miller vetoed that Even I ca n't understand all the footnotes he says
Instead he says if the salespeople can get the customers to consider Wang 's products on their merits he or a top financial officer will try to assuage the fears about finances
Mike Metschan a salesman in Wang 's Austin Texas office has a breezier method We tell them three billion dollars companies do n't go out of business
We tell them all the major companies are having financial difficulties
Numerous computer companies are having sales slumps and earnings declines but very few have had losses comparable to Wang 's or are carrying such a large debt load
Mr. Miller says that after a sharp sales slump in July and August sales stabilized in September
Although Wang will report a loss for the first quarter ended September thirtieth and the full fiscal year Mr. Miller says he expects the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter
Experts on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line
If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble it will be a problem for the long run says George Palmatier a Minden Nevada sales consultant and author of The Marketing Edge
Still says John Sullivan a management recruiter with Daniel Roberts Incorporated of Boston who has held senior sales positions at Polaroid and Atari The customer will react to strength
Ignore the present condition
Show it 's business as usual
That is n't easy
Wang 's customers are data processing managers who want to be sure that their suppliers are stable wellrun companies that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years to come
For buyers these are career risking decisions says Jean Conlin who supervises a network of Wang computers in the admissions department at Boston University
The university is considering installing a two hundred fifty thousand dollars system to store applications electronically
Before the really bad news we were looking at Wang fairly seriously she says
But their present financial condition means I 'd have a hard time convincing the vice president in charge of purchasing
Ms. Conlin adds At some point we 'd have to ask How do we know that in three years you wo n't be in Chapter eleven
During the past year Wang has developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president
Wang 's overall product line is still not as good as other vendors but they 've come a long way says Steven Wendler a consultant with market researcher Gartner Group Stamford Conn
They were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until this bad quarter happened
The first priority for Wang 's sales force is to make sure it holds on to existing customers
Wang 's installed base is one of its greatest assets and many of those customers remain extremely loyal
One Wang salesman who left the company in July recalls that when he tried to sell products to Eastman Kodak he worked to muster support from internal allies but those allies became skeptical as they saw the downtrend
The more recent losses were really devastating
New customers the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to Wang 's long term viability are even tougher
Rick Lynch a former top salesman in Wang 's Boston office referring to Wang 's mainstay computer line says You ca n't sell a V. S. to a new customer
Mr. Lynch left Wang this summer for Oracle Systems Incorporated a software vendor
The financial problems are particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing Wang 's image systems which convert paper forms to electronic documents
Consultants say that Wang 's technology is among the best available in the image market
But salespeople often found that news of Wang 's problems superseded their sales efforts
William Tait a former sales manager in Indianapolis says that his office had all but sold a one point five million dollars image system to pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly & Co
When they were making the decision all hell broke loose with the finances
He says the Lilly executives told him they could n't take the risk with Wang
Mr. Tait say he does n't blame Lilly
Buyers have to rely on a supplier continually upgrading and replacing the product he says
When a company realizes that it 's hard to go with Wang
For Mr. Tait who says he used to earn as much as one hundred fifty thousand dollars a year at Wang it was one more reason to quit
He is now president of Eastate Homes Incorporated an Indianapolis contractor
It can be hard for a salesperson to fight off feelings of discouragement
Brian Petre a former Wang salesman in upstate New York says You have pride in your job
You think you can go out and turn things around
It 's a tough thing when you ca n't
The reason does n't relate to your selling skills
Discouragement feeds on itself
The problem is if people get down in the dumps they stop selling says Mike Durcan a laid off sales manager in Wang 's Austin office
One key for salespeople is to boost their own morale
Paul Hellman a Framingham Massachusetts sales and management consultant and author of Ready Aim You 're Hired says The bad news is you 'll be rejected more
The good news is it 's not your fault
So he advises make goals achievable
For instance he suggests that salespeople making telephone calls should say to themselves All I want to do today is get fifty rejections
But Mr. Miller Wang 's new president recently warned his salespeople about negativism
Our customers watch us for the hidden message he said
Look a customer right in the eye and say I 'm glad to be at Wang
Blinder International Enterprises Incorporated the parent of beleaguered penny stockbroker Blinder Robinson & Company said its shareholders approved a previously announced name change to Intercontinental Enterprises Incorporated
The parent company is diversifying into other industries around the world said president Meyer Blinder in explaining the name change
Everytime we talked about Blinder International people thought it was the brokerage house
Mr. Blinder said the change was n't related to the brokerage 's recent troubles which have included sharp declines in earnings run ins with the securities regulators and lawsuits by former customers
The company said it expects the name change to take effect within a week

Charles Schellke an analyst with Smith Barney Harris Upham & Company said some investors apparently expected slightly better revenue growth
The company said that residential traffic grew faster than business traffic and attributed that to its new PrimeTime calling plan that competes with American Telephone & Telegraph 's Reach Out America plan
M. C. I. claims about twelve percent of the overall long distance telephone market but just under ten percent of the twenty three billion dollars residential market
It has been trying to improve its share of the residential market
The company wants its business mix to more closely match that of A. T. & T. a step it says will help prevent cross subsidization
Mr. Akerson said M. C. I. recorded another solid cash positive quarter its fourth in a row but declined to comment on whether the company is considering a dividend or is planning any acquisition

Arbitragers were n't the only big losers in the collapse of U. A. L. Corporation stock
Look at what happened to U. A. L. 's chairman Stephen M. Wolf and its chief financial officer John C. Pope
When bank financing for the buy out collapsed last week so did U. A. L. 's stock
Even if the banks resurrect a financing package at two hundred fifty dollars a share the two executives would still get about twenty five million dollars less than they stood to gain in the initial transaction
Mr. Wolf owns seventy five thousand U. A. L. shares and has options to buy another two hundred fifty thousand at eighty three point three one two five dollars each
In the three hundred dollars a share buyout that totaled about seventy six point seven million dollars
By yesterday 's close of trading it was good for a paltry forty three point five million dollars
Of course Mr. Wolf forty eight years old has some savings
He left his last two jobs at Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger with combined stock option gains of about twenty two million dollars and U. A. L. gave him a fifteen million dollars bonus when it hired him
His nineteen eighty eight salary was five hundred seventy five thousand dollars with a five hundred seventy five thousand dollars bonus
The forty year old Mr. Pope has n't changed jobs enough at least the right ones to stash away that kind of money
Mr. Pope owns ten thousand U. A. L. shares and has options to buy another one hundred fifty thousand at sixty nine dollars each

In the same statement U. S. Facilities also said it had bought back one hundred twelve thousand of its common shares in a private transaction
Terms were n't disclosed
The buy back represents about three percent of the company 's shares based on the three point seven million shares outstanding as of September thirtieth
In national over the counter trading yesterday U. S. Facilities closed at three point six two five dollars unchanged
Three leading drug companies reported robust third quarter earnings bolstered by strong sales of newer big selling prescriptions drugs that provide hefty profit margins
Merck & Company reported a twenty five percent increase in earnings Warner Lambert Company 's profit rose twenty two percent and Eli Lilly & Company 's net income rose twenty four percent
The results were in line with analysts ' expectations
Merck & Co
Merck Rahway N. J. continued to lead the industry with a strong sales performance in the human and animal health products segment
A stronger U. S. dollar reduced third quarter and first nine month sales growth two percent and three percent respectively
International sales accounted for forty seven percent of total company sales for the nine months compared with fifty percent a year earlier
Sales for the quarter rose to one point six three billion dollars from one point four seven billion dollars
Mevacor Merck 's new cholesterol lowering drug had higher sales than any other prescription medicine has ever achieved in the U. S. in the year following introduction the company said
The drug was introduced in West Germany this year
Intense competition however led to unit sales declines for a group of Merck 's established human and animal health products including Aldomet and Indocin
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Merck shares closed at seventy five dollars and twenty five cents up fifty cents
Warner Lambert Co
Warner Lambert Morris Plains N. J. reported sales that were a record for any quarter and the eighth quarter in a row of twenty percent or more per share earnings growth
Sales for the quarter rose to one point one one billion dollars from one point oh three billion dollars
Prescription drug world wide sales rose nine percent in the quarter to three hundred forty million dollars U. S. sales rose fifteen percent
The segment 's growth was led by sales of the cardiovascular drugs Lopid a lipid regulator and Dilzem a calcium channel blocker
Confectionery products sales also had strong growth in the quarter
World wide sales of Trident gum Certs breath mints and Clorets gum and breath mints increased twelve percent to two hundred seventy seven million dollars
Warner Lambert shares closed at one hundred nine dollars and fifty cents a share up one dollar and fifty cents in Big Board composite trading yesterday
Eli Lilly & Co

Third quarter sales of the Indianapolis Indiana company rose eleven percent to one point oh four five billion dollars from nine hundred forty point six million dollars
Nine month sales grew twelve percent to three point three nine billion dollars from three point oh three billion dollars a year earlier
Sales of Prozac an anti depressant led drug sales increases
Higher sales of pesticides and other plant science products more than offset a slight decline in the sales of animal health products to fuel the increase in world wide agricultural product sales Lilly said
Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Incorporated and Cardiac Pacemakers Incorporated units led growth in the medical instrument systems division
Lilly shares closed yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board at sixty two dollars and twenty five cents down twelve point five cents
Reuben Mark chairman of Colgate Palmolive Company said he is comfortable with analysts ' estimates that third quarter earnings rose to between ninety five cents and one dollar and five cents a share
That compares with per share earnings from continuing operations of sixty nine cents the year earlier including discontinued operations per share was eighty eight cents a year ago
The per share estimates mean the consumer products company 's net income increased to between sixty nine point five million and seventy six million dollars from forty seven point one million dollars the year before period
Analysts estimate Colgate 's world wide third quarter sales rose about eight percent to one point two nine billion dollars
Mr. Mark attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in Latin America Asia and Europe
Results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit by Colgate 's U. S. business Mr. Mark said
Operating profit at Colgate 's U. S. household products and personal care businesses jumped twenty five percent in the quarter Mr. Mark added
He said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations blending two sales organizations and focusing more carefully the company 's promotional activities
The estimated improvement in Colgate 's U. S. operations took some analysts by surprise
Colgate 's household products business which includes such brands as Fab laundry detergent and Ajax cleanser has been a weak performer
Analysts estimate Colgate 's sales of household products in the U. S. were flat for the quarter and they estimated operating margins at only one percent to three percent
If you could say their business in the U. S. was mediocre but great everywhere else that would be fine says Bonita Austin an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co
But it 's not mediocre it 's a real problem
Mr. Mark conceded that Colgate 's domestic business apart from its highly profitable Hill 's Pet Products unit has lagged
We 've done a lot to improve U. S. results and a lot more will be done Mr. Mark said
Improving profitability of U. S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company
To focus on its global consumer products business Colgate sold its Kendall health care business in nineteen eighty eight

By late last night Globe Managing Editor Thomas Mulvoy bending to the will of his troops scrapped the new drawings
For a few days at least he says no pictures or drawings of any kind will adorn the columns
Trouble was nobody thought they looked right
Mr. Barnicle reminded readers that he still has n't forgiven Globe management for questioning a twenty dollars expense chit he submitted for parking his car while chasing a story
I thought the drawing a cross between someone you 'd spot whipping open his trench coat or a guy who boasted he 'd been Charles Manson 's roommate for the last nineteen years he said

Deeply ingrained in both the book review Kissing Nature Good bye by Stephen MacDonald Leisure & Arts September twenty seventh and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity
Is such a view justified
In the absence of humans would the Earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term
Clearly not
About twenty thousand years ago the last ice age ended
Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America northern Europe and Asia
This global warming must have been entirely natural nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand hunter gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves
Furthermore no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming
It is probably continuing and may well account for most of or all of present day global warming
Jocelyn Tomkin Astronomy Department University of
The Internal Revenue Service plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation
The I. R. S. also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer who will be hired from within the agency
I. R. S. Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said the changes are intended to bring accountability to the agency which has an annual budget of more than five billion dollars and collects about one trillion dollars a year
My assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget Mr. Goldberg said
And we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend five billion dollars properly
Mr. Goldberg who took over as head of the I. R. S. in July has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency
The I. R. S. operates on a computer system designed in nineteen sixty one which it has been trying to modernize for years
And the agency which operated throughout fiscal nineteen eighty nine with a three hundred sixty million dollars budget shortfall has been under a hiring freeze since last fall
The new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward enhancing its ability to collect more tax revenue
I think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which in turn I believe will result in a significant increase in revenue he said
The I. R. S. hopes to fill the new positions soon
Customarily it would appoint career civil servants from within the agency but Mr. Goldberg said he plans to scour the world for the chief information officer and the comptroller
Although the jobs will probably pay between seventy thousand and eighty thousand dollars a year I. R. S. officials are confident that they can attract top notch candidates from the private sector
On the comptroller side you 're developing and making work financial controls governing a six billion dollars budget
When Major Moises Giroldi the leader of the abortive coup in Panama was buried his body bore several gunshot wounds a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs
They were the signature of his adversary Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega
The rebel officer 's slow and painful death at the headquarters of Panama 's Battalion two thousand oh squad was personally supervised by General Noriega says a U. S. official with access to intelligence reports
Leaping into rages sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust Mr. Noriega has put to death some seventy of his troops involved in the coup according to U. S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City
He is now changing the place he sleeps every night sometimes more than once a night
His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts his full time mistress Vicky Amado and her mother Norma
And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters
More enemies to be dealt with
In the two weeks since the rebellion which the U. S. hesitantly backed Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal and efficient in maintaining power
Yet while the failed coup is a major U. S. foreign policy embarrassment it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades
America 's war on the dictator over the past two years following his indictment on drug charges in February nineteen eighty eight is the legacy of that relationship
Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama 's long history of conspirators and pirates
For most of the past thirty years the marriage was one of convenience
The woman had nearly died
But U. S. intelligence rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy merely filed the report away
Mr. Noriega 's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U. S. interests
From that point on the U. S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian 's misadventures
The U. S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators but none quite so resourceful
Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them
And out of necessity The U. S. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power but a single error on his part could cost him his life
The U. S. underestimated Noriega all along says Ambler Moss a former Ambassador to Panama
He has mastered the art of survival
In keeping with America 's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega recent U. S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival
If the U. S. had sat back and done nothing he might not have made it through nineteen eighty eight Mr. Moss contends
Perhaps most important Mr. Noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage in some cases to demand that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne
One Colombian drug boss upon hearing in nineteen eighty seven that General Noriega was negotiating with the U. S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile sent him a hand sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name
He is cornered says the Reverend Fernando Guardia who has led Catholic Church opposition against Noriega
The Americans have left him without a way out
It is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option
His chief advantage in the fight his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses
Mr. Noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation
The U. S. discovered the young Tony Noriega in late nineteen fifty nine when he was in his second year at the Chorrillos Military Academy in Lima according to former U. S. intelligence officials
The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega 's half brother a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado
Luis Carlos knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer relayed Tony 's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and more important among his officers and instructors
A spy was born
It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega who was known to his friends as Cara la Pina pineapple face
Born the illegitimate son of his father 's maid he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City
Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate
He considered himself intellectually superior to his Peruvian peers many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well off families to the highly disciplined French modeled academy as a sort of reform school
In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed French made uniform Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life friends from the period say
He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism where officers were the elite with special privileges recalls Darien Ayala a fellow student in Peru and a lifelong friend
Mr. Noriega 's relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either nineteen sixty six or nineteen sixty seven intelligence officials say
His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison Major Omar Torrijos gave him an intriguing assignment Mr. Noriega would organize the province 's first intelligence service
United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama 's national income
Satisfying its interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader
Mr. Noriega 's initial retainer was only fifty to one hundred dollars a month plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American P. X. a former intelligence official says
It was modest pay by American standards but a healthy boost to his small military salary which fellow officers remember as having been three hundred to four hundred dollars monthly
He did it very well recalls Boris Martinez a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation
He started building the files that helped him gain power
A National Guard job assumed by Captain Noriega in nineteen sixty four as chief of the transit police in David City capital of the Chiriqui Province was tailor made for an aspiring super spy
By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses he gained a ready cache of information
He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk which had been found with their mistresses
This proved particularly valuable to the Panamanian government in nineteen sixty seven when union leaders were planning a May Day march that the government feared could turn violent
Mr. Noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy
So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana exporting city of Puerto Armuelles which was ruled by United Fruit Co
The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control
It was like a play on Broadway recalls Mr. Martinez
Noriega managed the whole thing
He was superb
Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people
During his years in Chiriqui however Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious
Rodrigo Miranda a local lawyer and human rights monitor recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the fifth Zone Garrison headquarters in David where he had his offices
Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked laughing at them and then retreating to his office
People started wondering if something was wrong with him Mr. Miranda recalls
But through this period so far as the U. S. military was concerned Mr. Noriega was a model recruit
He flew to Fort Bragg N. C. in September of that year for a course in psychological operations returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two month course called military intelligence for officers
Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty but they did so falsely
He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama 's socalled G. two in nineteen seventy after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier
He became General Torrijos 's inseparable shadow and the holder of all Panama 's secrets
Mr. Noriega by now a lieutenant colonel expanded his contacts to include the Cubans not to mention the Israelis the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking
When U. S. diplomats complained to the C. I. A. of Colonel Noriega 's moonlighting intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans
Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans
Even at this early stage drugs caused additional concerns
During the Nixon administration the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G. two 's connections to arrested drug traffickers
One D. E. A. agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Colonel Noriega one of which was assassination
The head of the D. E. A. at the time John Ingersoll scotched the assassination plan
But he did fly to Panama to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials including Mr. Noriega
Mr. Ingersoll later recalled that General Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U. S.
Everybody was afraid of him Mr. Ingersoll says
The tapes included wiretaps of General Torrijos 's own phone according to American intelligence officials
We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar says former C. I. A. Director Stansfield Turner
For the first time the U. S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll and the deliberations were intense Mr. Turner says
In the world of intelligence if you want to get information you get it from seedy characters
The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you
Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr. Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others
Mr. Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U. S. contract with the rent a colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration
The U. S. soon found new cause for concern gun running
Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza
They included one of Mr. Noriega 's closest friends and business partners Carlos Wittgreen
And the investigators were quickly closing in on Mr. Noriega himself
At the time though in nineteen seventy nine the U. S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy
Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon
Dade County and federal authorities learning that he intended to fly through Miami made plans to arrest him on the gun running charges as soon as he hit U. S. soil
It was a Friday in June
The Pentagon foiled the plan
According to military officers at the time word was passed to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting
On Monday U. S. officials received a routine unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama
Due to health reasons Lieutenant Colonel Noriega has elected to postpone his visit to Washington it read
Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback
Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen the friend of Mr. Noriega and the other four was dismissed on a technicality
But now along with reindicting Mr. Noriega 's pal they intended to charge Mr. Noriega himself on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some two million dollars in arms
In January nineteen eighty Jerome Sanford as assistant U. S. attorney was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms in Miami
Panamanian dictator Torrijos he was told had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington
Mr. Sanford was told Mr. Noriega 's friend Mr. Wittgreen would be handling the shah 's security
It would n't be a good idea to indict him much less Mr. Noriega the prosecutor was told
After prodding from Mr. Sanford U. S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed
The letter along with a detailed prosecution memo sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death
I think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now Mr. Sanford says
If he had been found guilty we could have stopped him
Soon the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses
The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega 's G. two back on the U. S. payroll
Payments averaged nearly two hundred thousand dollars a year from the U. S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the C. I. A.
Although working for U. S. intelligence Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U. S. exclusively
During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas
But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House would n't act against him recalls his close ally Jose Blandon because he had an insurance policy his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua
Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama
Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua
And on at least one occasion in the spring of nineteen eighty five he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua
Although his help for the Contra cause was limited it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration says Senator Patrick Leahy a Vermont Democrat who then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee
Noriega played U. S. intelligence agencies and the U. S. government like a violin he says
An incident in nineteen eighty four suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington by compromising U. S. officials
Curtin Windsor then the ambassador to Costa Rica recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega 's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and quiet serious conversation on the Aswara Peninsula
Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs the U. S. ambassador to Panama of the invitation
Briggs screamed Mr. Windsor recalls
He says Mr. Briggs told him he was being set up for a honey trap in which Mr. Noriega would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event with sound and video
Mr. Briggs on vacation after resigning his position at the National Security Council could n't be reached for comment
As Mr. Noriega 's political troubles grew so did his offers of assistance to the Contras an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington
For instance he helped steal the May nineteen eighty four Panamanian elections for the ruling party
But just one month later he also contributed one hundred thousand dollars to a Contra leader according to documents released for Oliver North 's criminal trial in Washington D. C.
Yet his political setbacks mounted
Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in nineteen eighty five the beheading of Hugo Spadafora his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges
He then ousted President Nicholas Ardito Barletta a former World Bank official with close ties to the U. S. after Mr. Barletta tried to create a commission to investigate the murder
And all the while Panama 's debt problems continued to grow
Mr. Noriega was growing desperate
In late nineteen eighty six he made an offer he thought the U. S. could n't refuse
North the document went on referring to Oliver North has told Noriega 's representative that U. S. law forbade such actions
The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things just as Noriega had helped the U. S. the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal
Colonel North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams who relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz
Mr. Noriega 's proposal was turned down
And Mr. Shultz curtly told Mr. Abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image
The end of the marriage was at hand
Within weeks the unfolding Iran Contra scandal took away Mr. Noriega 's insurance policy
The death of C. I. A. Director William Casey and resignation of Oliver North allowed anti Noriega political forces to gain influence
Few American officials were willing any longer to defend him
Lawyers in Miami this time working virtually without impediment prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in February nineteen eighty eight
Now neither side the U. S. nor Mr. Noriega has an easy out
President Bush has sworn to bring him to justice
Mr. Noriega believes he has n't any alternative but to continue clutching to power
It is a knock out battle perhaps to the death
In the end is Mr. Noriega the political equivalent of Frankenstein 's monster created by a well intentioned but misguided foreign power
Not quite Senator Leahy contends
For short term gains people were willing to put up with him
That allowed him to get stronger and stronger he says
I do n't think we created him as much as we fed him nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong
UPJOHN Company reported that third quarter net income rose to ninety six million dollars or fifty two cents a share from eighty nine point six million dollars or forty nine cents a share a year earlier
Yesterday 's edition provided analysts ' estimates for the company when actual earnings were available
Industrial production declined zero point one percent in September reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend
Capital spending and exports which have been the driving force in this expansion are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them said Robert Dederick economist for Northern Trust Company in Chicago
They need to do something about this said Maury Harris economist at PaineWebber Group Incorporated
The Fed also said U. S. industry operated at eighty three point six percent of capacity last month down from eighty three point eight percent in August
Measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures
Factory output dropped zero point two percent its first decline since February after having been unchanged in October
Factories operated at eighty three point seven percent of capacity the lowest rate in more than a year and down from eighty four point one percent in September
The declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods those intended to last more than three years
The biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers a category that includes the steel industry
Output of business equipment was unchanged in September
Production of factory equipment one indication of the strength of manufacturers ' investment spending fell zero point three percent
Some economists expect further declines in investment spending
Whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soften subsequently Mr. Harris said
You have n't seen the full effect of that yet
A decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto assemblies the Fed noted
Analysts do n't expect the September surge in auto production to be repeated in the coming months
Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board 's report on industrial production in September
The figures are seasonally adjusted
one hundred forty two point three percent of the nineteen seventy seven average
Robin Honiss president and chief executive officer of this bank holding company was elected to the additional posts of chairman president and chief executive of the company 's New England Savings Bank subsidiary
William R. Attridge resigned those posts as well as a seat on N. E. S. B. 's board
N. E. S. B. is also the parent of Omnibank
Lung cancer mortality rates for people under forty five years of age have begun to decline federal researchers report
The drop is particularly large for white males although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality rates
What this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact said Melvyn Tockman an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore
The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of thirty five and forty four a decade apart
Measured the same way the decline for black males was fourteen point two percent
The drop in mortality rates for women was less steep eight point nine percent for blacks and five point three percent for whites
Although lung cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the nineteen nineties for men and after the year two thousand oh for women
Lung cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over fifty five with sharp increases for everybody but white men
But Doctor Fraumeni one of the authors of the report said the declining rates we 're seeing for younger people we believe may be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future
However he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking
Even though these favorable trends in lung cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups they ca n't be taken for granted the report says
Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population especially children adolescents and minorities
But the editorial by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization notes that tobacco consumption and lung cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries
Non smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior around the world the editorial says through the enactment of laws that limit advertising boost tobacco prices and promote anti smoking education
Asked for comment Walker Merryman a vice president of the Tobacco Institute said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the U. S. could violate the First Amendment protection of free speech
According to the American Cancer Society smoking is responsible for eighty five percent of the lung cancer cases among men and seventy five percent among women
The N. C. I. report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns
A higher proportion of black men smoke than white men
While nearly equal percentages of black and white women currently smoke in both sexes more whites have given up smoking than blacks
In comparing changes in mortality rates over the past decade the N. C. I. study looked only at blacks and whites
Asians and native Americans were n't studied Hispanics were included with whites
Recent changes in average annual age specific lung cancer rates per one hundred thousand population by race and sex

Every time you thought it was going into a rally it gave up and every time you thought it would rally it came down
This is a tough market
Mr. Zipper said the market is still settling down after the recent correction
Most of trading action now is from professional traders who are trying to take advantage of the price swings to turn a quick profit he and other traders said
Everybody 's confused and no one has an opinion that lasts longer than thirty seconds said Mr. Zipper
A lot of the professional traders are just going back and forth
They 're just as confused
William Rothe head of O. T. C. trading at Alex Brown & Sons in Baltimore said program trading is keeping the markets unsettled

Certainly conservative environmentalists can defend their limited government position by differentiating between Old Environmentalism and New Environmentalism Journalists and Others for Saving the Planet by David Brooks editorial page October fifth
Old Environmentalism involved microbe hunters and sanitationists
It started with improvements in hygiene made possible by affordable soap and washable underwear during the Industrial Revolution
Then cast iron sewer pipe and the flush toilet were followed by sewage and water treatment plants toward the end of the nineteenth century
Medicine in the nineteenth century was dedicated mostly to combating sepsis and diagnostic analysis
Then the twentieth century saw the evolution of private sector wonder drugs which promulgated medical therapy
The process dramatically increased our average life expectancy eliminated much pain and constantly improved health and well being
Most public health measures were handled at the local level
New Environmentalism probably started in nineteen sixty two with the publication of Rachel Carson 's book Silent Spring
Shortly thereafter hysterical articles began to appear predicting that advanced industrial societies would produce a blackened uninhabitable planet possibly by the turn of the century
These apocalyptic predictions were advanced by such stalwarts as Paul Ehrlich Barry Commoner Rene Dubois and George Wald
Writing in the nineteen sixties Ms. Carson suggested that the human race could be eliminated in twenty years and Mr. Wald suggested that life on earth might end by nineteen eighty five
Mr. Ehrlich predicted unprecedented famine by nineteen eighty
There were many more
Thousands of chemical products were categorized as carcinogenic with recommendations that they be banned from industrial use because they produced malignant tumors in overdosed rats
Unknown before nineteen sixty were the inconclusive effects of acid rain greenhouse warming and ozone depletion all of which required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense
Meanwhile the New Environmentalists systematically opposed the methods of the Old Environmentalists
Local pollution problems require cheap energy and capital for their solution
But the New Environmentalists oppose private wealth creation which they claim depletes natural resources and nuclear power even though it would counteract the greenhouse effect
They are in the forefront of opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering
New Environmentalism is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power
Let 's rationalize our priorities by solving pollution problems at the local level as heretofore

Your story missed some essential points of the conference on The Global Environment Are We Overreacting
First and foremost the vignettes presented by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment
Consider for example the greenhouse effect and climate change numerous blue ribbon scientific committees including one from the National Academy of Science judge there is a greater than fifty percent probability of a grave problem in the offing
The point was to answer the question in the conference title not to try to create news stories for the event itself
Nor was it intended to dictate a set of prescriptive solutions although various points were raised
Each speaker was asked to address a specific topic not deliver a point of view
Each scientist independently concluded society and government are underreacting when it comes to substantive policy change
This leads to a very special sense of urgency
If the media decide to work harder at educating the public about these complex and technical issues that hardly can be termed non objective journalism
The environment can no longer be a normal issue to be dealt with on a business as usual basis with comfortable increments of change
We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet 's atmosphere
This portends consequences from what we have already done that will be very destabilizing to social and economic systems
The consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes
No we are not overreacting

Coca Cola Enterprises Incorporated fulfilling its dismal earnings forecast for nineteen eighty nine said its third quarter net income fell sixty eight percent on flat revenue
The results met estimates of analysts who had already slashed their projections after the company said in late August that its nineteen eighty nine earnings could tumble as much as thirty seven percent
A company spokesman said yesterday that Coca Cola Enterprises sticks by its nineteen eighty nine forecast
Third quarter revenue was flat at one point oh two billion dollars
The year ago results however included the operations of a bottling business which was sold last December
Excluding that bottling business Coca Cola Enterprises ' volume measured by cases of soda rose only one percent
The volume is well below the industry 's four percent to five percent growth rate of recent years but in line with other soft drink companies for the third quarter
The latest third quarter volume also compares with a very strong ten percent growth in the year ago quarter
Coca Cola Enterprises blamed the lower volume on its soft drink prices which were about three percent higher in the third quarter
Consumers have been accustomed to buying soft drinks at discounted prices for several years
Coca Cola Enterprises said it had to boost spending for trade and dealer incentives to try to keep volumes from slipping
The company said it expects consumers will adjust to higher priced soft drinks
A spokesman attributed the bulk of a fourteen percent increase in selling administrative and general expenses to three hundred twenty four point nine million dollars to marketing costs
They 're out there promoting like crazy trying to get prices up by promotion said Roy Burry an analyst with Kidder Peabody & Co
For the nine months Coca Cola Enterprises ' net fell thirty one percent to sixty five million dollars or thirty nine cents a share from ninety three point eight million dollars or sixty three cents a share
Revenue was flat at about two point nine seven billion dollars
Coca Cola Enterprises which is forty nine percent owned by Coca Cola Company also said it repurchased about one point two million of its common shares during the third quarter
The buy back is part of a twenty five million share repurchase plan under which Coca Cola Enterprises so far has acquired a total of nine point seven million shares
Sales rose twenty five percent to three point nine zero billion dollars from three point one three billion dollars
The year ago quarter 's results include an after tax charge of five point nine million dollars from the sale of a winery in Spain
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Coca Cola Enterprises closed at sixteen point three seven five dollars a share down sixty two point five cents
PepsiCo closed at fifty eight dollars and fifty cents a share up one point three seven five dollars
L. J. Hooker Corporation is expected to reach an agreement in principle this week to sell Merksamer Jewelers Incorporated to management say executives familiar with the talks
L. J. Hooker based in Atlanta filed for Chapter eleven bankruptcy protection earlier this year
Currently its parent company Hooker Corporation of Sydney Australia is being managed by a court appointed liquidator
It is expected that G. E. Capital Corporation a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Company will provide much of the funding for the proposed leveraged buy out of Merksamer based in Sacramento Calif
A spokesman for G. E. Capital declined to comment
G. E. Capital has a working relationship with L. J. Hooker
Sam Merksamer chief executive officer of the nationwide jewelry chain and Sanford Sigoloff chief executive of L. J. Hooker Corporation both declined to comment
Currently Mr. Merksamer owns twenty percent of the company L. J. Hooker acquired its eighty percent interest in the firm in May nineteen eighty six
At the time the Merksamer chain had eleven stores in operation
Today there are seventy seven units all located in shopping malls
In recent weeks Mr. Merksamer has approached a number of his suppliers and asked them to provide letters of intent saying they will continue shipping merchandise to the chain following the buy out say those familiar with the situation
This year a number of retail leveraged buyouts have failed causing jitters among suppliers and Mr. Merksamer apparently wanted assurances that he wo n't have delivery problems
For the year ended June thirtieth nineteen eighty nine Merksamer Jewelers had sixty two million dollars of revenue and operating profit of two point five million dollars
The jewelery chain was put up for sale in June
According to those familiar with the situation other bidders included Ratners Group P. L. C. of London and Kay Jewelers Incorporated
First Boston Corporation is advising L. J. Hooker on the sale of the Merksamer business
Merksamer was the first in a series of retail acquisitions made by L. J. Hooker
The company was founded in Sacramento in nineteen twenty nine by two brothers Ralph and Walter Merksamer who operated as DeVon 's Jewelers
In nineteen seventy nine the pair split the company in half with Walter and his son Sam agreeing to operate under the Merksamer Jewelery name
The sale of Merksamer Jewelers is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U. S. Bankruptcy Court
The offer which did n't include the Merksamer chain is being reviewed by Mr. Sigoloff
Robert J. Regal was named president and chief executive officer of this company 's Universal Rundle Corporation unit
Mr. Regal had been president and chief executive of R. B. S. Industries Incorporated

The days may be numbered for animated shows featuring Alf the Karate Kid and the Chipmunks
N. B. C. a leader in morning prime time and late night programs but an also ran on Saturday mornings when children rule the T. V. set is contemplating getting out of the cartoon business
Instead network officials say it may counterprogram with shows for an audience that is virtually ignored in that time period adults
There is talk of some revamping and we 're certainly heading in the direction of less and less animation said Joseph S. Cicero vice president of finance and administration for National Broadcasting Company a unit of General Electric Co
Mr. Cicero said that N. B. C. Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff who declined to be interviewed is looking at options now and may put some things into the schedule by mid season
He declined to elaborate
N. B. C. 's options could range from news oriented programming to sports shows although the network declined to comment
One major N. B. C. affiliate K. C. R. A. in Sacramento plans to cancel the N. B. C. Saturday morning line up as of January and replace it with a local newscast
The one hour program will be repeated with updates throughout Saturday mornings
We feel there is an opportunity for an audience that is not being served by any network so we want to take the lead says K. C. R. A. 's general manager John Kueneke
We do n't need cartoons anymore
They only accounted for five percent at best of the station 's total revenues
An N. B. C. spokesman says the network will closely monitor the Sacramento situation and says it is the only station to defect
Spokesmen for the television networks of C. B. S. Incorporated and Capital Cities A. B. C. Incorporated say there are no plans to alter the children 's line up on Saturday mornings
The youthful audience for Saturday programming is no longer dependent on the networks
There has been a surge in syndicated children 's shows to independent stations as well as competition from videocassettes for kids and from cable outlets such as Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel
At the same time there appears to be a market for news oriented programming Turner Broadcasting System Incorporated 's Cable News Network has its highest ratings outside of prime time on Saturday mornings
N. B. C. has on previous occasions considered replacing cartoons with a Saturday version of Today which is produced by N. B. C. News
The network 's own production company N. B. C. Productions supplies a half hour family oriented show titled Saved By The Bell
N. B. C. Productions or N. B. C. News could supply the network with other Saturday morning shows a move that would control costs
Animated shows which are made by outside production companies cost the network about three hundred thousand dollars per episode
Rohm & Haas Company said third quarter net income skidded thirty five percent to thirty two point six million dollars or forty nine cents a share
In the year earlier quarter the chemicals company had net of forty nine point eight million dollars or seventy five cents a share
Sales were six hundred twenty three million dollars up zero point five percent from six hundred nineteen point eight million dollars a year ago
Rohm & Haas which plans to start operating seven new production units this year attributed the profit slide partly to higher start up expense
The company also cited the stronger dollar which cuts the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars
In addition the company said it was hurt by higher than previous year costs for raw materials though those costs have declined since the second quarter
Incrementally higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs such as overtime pay
Sales rose five point two percent to two point oh four billion dollars from one point nine four billion dollars the previous year
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Rohm & Haas closed at thirty three dollars a share down one dollar and seventy five cents
Michael A. Gaskin fifty five years old was named president and chief executive officer of this manufacturer of industrial robots succeeding Walter K. Weisel

This is written to correct a misquotation in your October third article Deaths From Advanced Colon Cancer Can Be Reduced by Using Two Drugs
In this article I was alleged to have said Any patient with high risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if he 's not getting this therapy
I did n't say this and I 'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote
I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs levamisole and five fluorouracil to any of my colon cancer patients
With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high risk colon cancer by one third but this leaves the two thirds who are dying of cancer
This is not nearly good enough
I believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients both today and tomorrow should offer the hope of something better than that
My statement read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the National Cancer Institute news conference was the following New clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results
These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better
I feel any patient with high risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity
We have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead
This hope however will never be realized if we use levamisole and five fluorouracil as a stopping point

The oil and auto industries united in their dislike of President Bush 's proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels announced a joint research program that could turn up a cleaner burning gasoline
Officials of the Big Three auto makers and fourteen petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most cost effective fuel for reducing cities ' air pollution problems with no bias toward any fuel in particular
However their search notably wo n't include natural gas or pure methanol the two front running alternative fuels in tests to be completed by next summer
Instead the tests will focus heavily on new blends of gasoline which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is choking urban areas
Environmentalists criticized the program as merely a public relations attempt to head off a White House proposal to require a million cars a year that run on cleaner burning fuels by nineteen ninety seven
While major oil companies have been experimenting with cleaner burning gasoline blends for years only Atlantic Richfield Company is now marketing a lower emission gasoline for older cars currently running on leaded fuel
The initial eleven million dollars research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of reformulated gasolines said Joe Colucci head of fuels and lubricants at General Motors Corporation research laboratories
It will compare twenty one different blends of gasolines with three mixtures of up to eighty five percent methanol
A second phase of research which is still being planned will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in nineteen ninety two or nineteen ninety three cars
There was no cost estimate for the second phase
The whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers said Keith McHenry a senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corporation
And we are looking for the most cost effective way to clean up the air
But David Hawkins an environmental lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council said the research appears merely to be a way to promote reformulated gasoline
Oil and auto companies supported a move on Capitol Hill last week to gut Mr. Bush 's plans to require auto makers to begin selling alternative fueled cars by nineteen ninety five
Instead a House subcommittee adopted a clean fuels program that specifically mentions reformulated gasoline as an alternative
The Bush administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes up a comprehensive clean air bill
Mr. Seidman who has been the nation 's top bank regulator inherited the problems of Lincoln based in Irvine California after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings and loan bailout law
He made his comments before House Banking Committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal ridden industry
The inquiry also will cover the actions of Charles Keating Junior who is chairman of American Continental Corporation Lincoln 's parent and who contributed heavily to several U. S. senators
Mr. Seidman told the committee that the Resolution Trust Corporation the agency created to sell sick thrifts has studied Lincoln 's examination reports by former regulators dating back to nineteen eighty six
My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions we would have sought an immediate cease and desist order to stop the hazardous operations Mr. Seidman said
But the government did n't step in until six months ago when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship the day after American Continental filed for Chapter eleven bankruptcy protection from creditors
The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court
I think it 's fairly clear Mr. Keating knew that regulators were set to seize Lincoln Mr. Seidman said
Further investigation he said may result in further actions against Lincoln 's executives said Mr. Seidman including fraud actions
Mr. Keating for his part has filed suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift
Leonard Bickwit an attorney in Washington for Mr. Keating declined to comment on the hearings except to say We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time
Lincoln 's treatment by former thrift regulators in an agency disbanded by the new law has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Mr. Keating
After the government lawsuit was filed against Lincoln Senator DeConcini returned the campaign contributions
The senator 's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because hundreds of Arizona jobs at Lincoln were on the line
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle D. Mich has also returned contributions he received from Mr. Keating a year ago
Senators John Glenn D. Ohio John McCain R. Arizona and Alan Cranston D. California also received substantial contributions from Mr. Keating and sought to intervene on behalf of Lincoln
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez D. Texas said Senator Cranston volunteered to appear before the House committee if necessary
But a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators
At the hearing Mr. Seidman said the R. T. C. has already pumped seven hundred twenty nine million dollars into Lincoln for liquidity
He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of two hundred twenty five million dollars in American Continental subordinated debt
Some of those debtholders have filed a suit saying they believed they were buying government insured certificates of deposit
We have no plans at this time to pay off those notes he said
Eastern Airlines ' creditors committee unhappy with the carrier 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy law proceedings asked its own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization
According to one person present at the meeting Eastern 's new plan is financially overly optimistic
Asked about the consultants ' reports an Eastern spokeswoman said we totally disagree
She said they have oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off base
He insisted as he has before that creditors would be paid in full under the plan
Mr. Lorenzo made no mention of creditors ' negative response to his plan
We 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly Mr. Lorenzo told reporters
We 're meeting and surpassing our goals he added
In July Eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for Eastern to sell one point eight billion dollars in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy law protection at two thirds its former size
But after selling off pieces such as its East Coast shuttle its Philadelphia hub and various planes Eastern hit a stumbling block
It could n't sell its South American routes one of the major assets marked for disposal
Those routes valued by the creditors ' professionals at about four hundred million dollars were to be sold to A. M. R. Corporation 's American Airlines
A last minute snag in negotiations with A. M. R. over an unrelated lawsuit between American and another Texas Air unit caused the deal to collapse
Eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization
It also would leave Eastern a bigger carrier than the scaled down one proposed under the initial plan
Those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped
Since then Eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions
The committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze Eastern 's plans
Both said the new plan would n't work
Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated Eastern would miss the same mark by one hundred twenty million to one hundred thirty five million dollars the source said
The experts said they expected Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated
Other costs also would increase including maintenance because Eastern has an older fleet
At the news conference Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes presented a far rosier assessment
Flanked by flight attendants pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms they said Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats
Starting next month Eastern will begin flying seven hundred seventy five flights daily instead of the previously announced seven hundred they said
Mr. Bakes declined to give out Eastern 's daily losses but said he did n't expect Eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow
These accounts hold several hundred million dollars primarily from asset sales
The plan Eastern hopes to pursue he said calls for Eastern to have three hundred ninety million dollars in cash by year 's end
Both he and Mr. Lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in January
As to negotiations with creditors Mr. Lorenzo said in remarks after the conference we 'll have to see how they talks come along
However he added it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors
It must be accepted by the court
Under bankruptcy law Eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan
That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again
If Eastern can get creditor support court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift
But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own
In any event some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes
Eastern sought bankruptcy law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March fourth
Mr. Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier eighty five percent to ninety percent of the size of the pre bankruptcy Eastern
He projected it would be operating about one thousand flights a day by late spring only slightly fewer than the carrier 's old volume of one thousand fifty a day
HOPES OF SIMPLIFYING the corporate minimum tax before nineteen ninety are weakening
The method of calculating the twenty percent tax paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way is due for a change in nineteen ninety thanks to nineteen eighty six 's tax act
But most experts agree that the concept that is to be introduced drags in great complexity they have been trying to head it off this year
Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski backed a simplification plan in the pending House tax bill but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser
Now the Senate 's stripped down bill omits any proposal to deal with the corporate tax
Proponents of simplification fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are waning
We hear it has low priority on the House side says Samuel Starr of Coopers & Lybrand CPAs
If the law is n't changed he says we are left staring at rules that are almost impossible to implement because there are so many complex depreciation calculations to do
But Congress still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next Starr adds
HUGO 'S RAVAGES may be offset by immediate claims for tax refunds
This law aids hurricane wracked locales named by the president as disaster areas as well as regions so designated after other nineteen eighty nine disasters
It lets victims elect to deduct casualty losses on either nineteen eighty nine or amended nineteen eighty eight returns whichever offers the larger tax benefit they have until April sixteenth to choose
Amending a nineteen eighty eight return to claim a refund brings cash faster but for personal losses there are other factors to consider notes publisher Prentice Hall
In filing an original not amended return a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether one spouse has larger income that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately
THE I. R. S. DELAYS several deadlines for Hugo 's victims
Interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes but late payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is ten percent or less of the liability

Among the provisions Fiscal year taxpayers with returns due last Monday wo n't be penalized if they file or request an extension and pay tax due by November fifteenth
Excise tax returns due by October thirty first or November thirtieth may be delayed to January sixteenth
Extensions ca n't be granted for filing employment tax returns due October thirty first or for depositing withheld taxes but late penalties will be abated for deposits made by November fifteenth
The notice also grants relief for certain estate tax returns

This says Ms. Peterson is what it 's all about
Twelve hundred miles away rangers at a Napa County California state park are among the many who do n't quite share the enthusiasm
This summer speeding bikers were blamed for an accident in the Napa County park in which a horse spooked on a trail that was closed to bikers broke its leg
The animal had to be destroyed the bikers fled and were never found
In numerous parks near San Francisco rangers have been forced to close trails set up speed traps and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding
They have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained they were being driven from trails
We were being overrun says Steve Fiala trails coordinator of the East Bay Regional Park District
Two years ago the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its sixty five thousand hilly acres
From about two hundred thousand six years ago the number of mountain bikes in the U. S. is expected to grow to ten million in nineteen ninety
At least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone
The controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all terrain bicycles is one of the most divisive storms to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory
Bikers many of them ardent environmentalists proclaim their sport an efficient safe fitness promoting way to get back to nature while asserting a right as taxpayers to pedal on public lands
But the bikes ' burgeoning numbers safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas from the Sierras to the Eastern Seaboard to ban them from the back country
Key to the issue is that the bikes in skillful hands can go virtually anywhere and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror
An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance
Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to forty miles an hour a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians
For harried public land managers across the nation the response is increasingly to shut the gates
The state of California following the lead of some regional parks recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles
The move largely consigns them to roads used by motorized vehicles
Most other states have enacted similar bans
The bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks
Often these closings come after vigorous anti bike lobbying by conservation organizations the politically potent Sierra Club among them
Sierra has been instrumental in securing a number of the California bans
It has been waging an all out campaign to beat back a proposal pushed by Utah bike groups to allow the cycles in federally designated wilderness areas where they are now prohibited
Yet Sierra 's hard line stance has created something of a rift in the organization which estimates that seventeen percent of its five hundred thousand members own mountain bikes
Pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti bike rhetoric it no longer for example lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain marring off road vehicles
But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes wo n't injure the environment or other users
People who feel that cyclists should be banned from an area are n't looking at the whole picture complains Mark Langton associate editor of Mountain and City Biking magazine in Canoga Park Calif
Mr. Langton is among the legions of bikers who got their first taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers
He says fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as hikers many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy
To fight back activists such as Mr. Langton are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails
Mr. Langton 's group Concerned Off Road Bicyclists Association mounted petition drives to help keep open certain Santa Monica Mountain trails designated for closing
Biking groups in Montana Idaho Michigan and Massachusetts have won similar concessions says Tim Blumenthal mountain bike editor of Bicycling magazine
Even staunch anti bike Sierra members concede that ten percent of all riders cause most of the problems
While some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through education and peer pressure says Jim Hasenauer a director of the International Mountain Biking Association
I think we 're making progress
Few would have foreseen such a furor when a decade ago some Marin County bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike using fat tires lightweight metallurgy and multi gear technology
They wanted a machine that would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles
They got a machine more responsive more stable and in many ways easier to ride than the thin tired racing bikes that then were the rage
When the bikes first entered mass production in nineteen eighty one they were dismissed as a fad
Last year twenty five percent of the ten million bicycles sold in the U. S. were mountain bikes
In California a bellwether market they accounted for more than eighty percent of all bike sales
The majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country
City dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes
Crested Butte population one thousand two hundred is a bastion of the sport
By one estimate everyone here under fifty owns at least one bike
The town is home to the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and it hosts the annual Fat Tire Bike Week
This summer the jamboree attracted more visitors than the busiest week of the town 's winter ski season
David Lindsey chairman of the Fat Tire Bike celebration muses that the bike 's popularity may be a combination of technology and nostalgia
The mountain bike feels as comfortable as the paperboy bike you had as a kid but it can do so much more he says

Stock market tremors again shook bond prices while the dollar turned in a mixed performance
Early yesterday investors scrambled to buy Treasury bonds for safety as stock prices plummeted and fears mounted of a replay of Friday
But stocks later recovered erasing most of their early declines
That cut short the rally in Treasury bonds and depressed prices moderately below late Monday 's levels
The Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than sixty point two five points early in the day finished eighteen point six five points lower at two thousand six hundred thirty eight point seven three
Long term Treasury issues declined about half a point or five dollars for each one thousand dollars face amount
The stock market clearly is leading the bond markets said Jack Conlon an executive vice president at Nikko Securities
People are breathing a major sigh of relief that the world did n't end Monday morning or yesterday
Gold a closely watched barometer of investor anxiety was little changed
The dollar initially fell against other major currencies on news that the U. S. trade deficit surged in August to ten point seven seven billion dollars
But the dollar later rebounded finishing slightly higher against the yen although slightly lower against the mark
Federal Reserve officials sent another signal of their determination to shore up investor confidence
In an apparent attempt to keep a lid on short term interest rates the Fed once again pumped money into the banking system
But the Fed move was a small gesture traders said
Fed officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does n't appear necessary several investment managers said
The Fed has allowed a key short term interest rate to decline about one quarter percentage point
The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks has been hovering around eight and three quarters percent down from nine percent previously
Although stocks have led bonds this week some traders predict that relationship will reverse during the next few weeks
Nikko 's Mr. Conlon fears a huge wave of Treasury borrowing early next month will drive down Treasury bond prices
That coupled with poor third quarter corporate earnings comparisons will make trouble for the equity market for the next two to three months he says

In major market activity Treasury bond prices fell
The yield on thirty year Treasury bonds climbed back above eight percent ending the day at eight point oh three percent
The dollar was mixed

In the nineteen eighty eight third quarter the forest products company reported profit of one hundred forty four point nine million dollars or sixty nine cents a share
Sales rose nine percent to two point five seven billion dollars from two point three six billion dollars
Sales rose nine percent to seven point five four billion dollars from six point nine five billion dollars
Forest products operations strengthened in the third quarter while paper operations were dogged by higher costs soft newsprint exports and a strong Japanese yen
Some competing forest products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business
Weyerhaeuser 's pulp and paper operations were up for the nine months but full year performance depends on the balance of operating and maintenance costs plus pricing of certain products the company said
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter the company said export log and lumber markets will be weak while panel and plywood markets will be stronger
Pulp and paper performance depends on cost and price variables the company said
Bankers Trust New York Corporation became the latest major U. S. bank to increase reserves for its loans to less developed countries making a one point six billion dollars third quarter addition to its provision
The bank also said it expects to report a one point four two billion dollars loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year
The new reserves bring the company 's provision for loans to Third World countries to two point six billion dollars or eighty five percent of Bankers Trust 's medium and long term loans to these countries
Step up to the plate and take the big swing
Get the problem behind you and do n't look back said James J. McDermott analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods in approving of the move
Bankers Trust has had the capacity to do this for some time the analyst said
He expects Citicorp to take a similar step this year
Three other major U. S. banks posted earnings increases
Wells Fargo & Company of San Francisco posted a seventeen percent jump
P. N. C. Financial Corporation the parent of Pittsburgh National Bank reported net income climbed nine point eight percent while net for Banc One Corporation of Columbus Ohio grew three point eight percent
Citicorp
Analysts were only slightly disappointed by Citicorp 's numbers
There 's nothing in here that 's horrible and nothing to make you think they 're setting the world on fire said Carole Berger analyst for C. J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell Incorporated
Earnings from the bank 's global consumer business grew twenty seven percent
The consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream said Mr. McDermott of Keefe Bruyette & Woods
Corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were relatively flat sometimes choppy the bank said and profit for the area sank twenty seven percent
The cross border loan portfolio reflected adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns the bank said no interest payments from Argentina in the nine months and none from Brazil in the third quarter while Venezuela brought itself substantially current
Overall the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to seventy million dollars from eighty million dollars a year earlier
People were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision for medium term and long term loans to less developed countries a Citicorp spokesman said
But he reiterated the bank 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of two point six billion dollars covering about thirty percent of the eight point nine billion dollars of such loans outstanding
Ronald I. Mandle analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company called Citicorp 's venture capital gains of ninety three million dollars before taxes strong
A concerning item the analyst cited was the ten percent jump in expenses which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit card operations and its overseas branch business
Citicorp 's spokesman said however that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth
Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks minimizing a drop in net interest margin with thirteen percent third quarter growth in high yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages
As a result Wells Fargo 's net interest income rose thirty six point three million dollars or seven percent to five hundred thirty seven million dollars for the quarter
Wells Fargo 's return on equity increased to twenty four point four percent from twenty three point eight percent
But the amount was still thirty nine percent higher than the year ago level and twenty five percent higher as a percentage of total loans
That trend and Wells Fargo 's heavy exposure to leveraged buy outs are about the only worries analysts have about Wells Fargo 's financial picture
Manufacturers Hanover
The comparable year earlier number was fifty six million dollars a spokesman said
The bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less developed countries to two point four billion dollars covering thirty six percent of its medium and long term loans outstanding to these nations
The net interest margin the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments improved in the quarter as did certain areas of wholesale banking
Fees from syndicating loans dropped forty eight percent to twenty one million dollars
We did n't take part in a lot of deals in the quarter because their credit quality was poor the spokesman said
Expenses unrelated to interest rose five point four percent to five hundred forty one million dollars
P. N. C. Financial
P. N. C. Financial cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said it continues to cut costs
Net interest income in the third quarter edged up one point four percent to three hundred seventeen point seven million dollars
Trust income grew fifteen percent to forty nine point nine million dollars while service charges fees and commissions increased twenty two percent to seventy nine point four million dollars
The bank 's total allowance for credit losses was five hundred two point one million dollars or one point eight two percent of total loans
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling Congress I Party control of the government
Other analysts say the Indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties
Elections in this large diverse and passionate nation are always hard to predict
Much depends on the opposition a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former Gandhi cabinet minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh
The biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against Mr. Gandhi and his five years in power five years of ups and downs promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity
Yesterday four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party Mr. Gandhi called elections for the lower house of Parliament on November twenty second and twenty four
The elections will be held in different states on one of the two days
The lower house 's five year term expires in January the Parliament 's upper house is appointed
The elections will be a rigorous test for the forty five year old prime minister and Congress I which in various forms has ruled for forty of India 's forty two years of independence
After a landslide win in nineteen eighty four in polls held after the assassination of his mother Indira Gandhi Mr. Gandhi saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride
His early promises to make India a modern nation remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy
His pledge to clean up local administration and Indian politics including his own party went unfulfilled
His Mr. Clean image was muddied by an arms kickback scandal which will be a major campaign issue
Some analysts predict that disappointment in Mr. Gandhi 's spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy handed local government will crest at the polls
There 's a wide feeling of indignation across the country says Bhabani Sen Gupta of the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi
I think the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman by a corrupt revenue collector
This could be a big protest against an administrative failure
Even if the Congress I retains control of the government Mr. Gandhi 's ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority
Economic analysts call his trail blazing liberalization of the Indian economy incomplete and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned firmly to power
The Lok Sabha or lower house of Parliament has five hundred forty two elected and two appointed seats
In nineteen eighty four the Congress I captured four hundred five seats the largest victory in the history of Indian democracy
The landslide was fueled by panic that prevailed in India at the time
Mrs. Gandhi had been assassinated by separatist Sikhs and many Indians feared their country might split apart
In the previous three general elections similar national issues clinched the vote
In nineteen seventy one the Congress Party won after India 's victory in the Bangladesh war
In nineteen seventy seven Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of office after her nineteen month emergency rule and in nineteen eighty after her successors made a mess of their three years in power she was restored to office
Most political analysts say that if Mr. Gandhi 's opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts the Congress I will lose big
But if the opposition remains fractured the Congress I could win a small majority or lead a coalition government
Chimanbhai Mehta a parliamentarian and former Gandhi ally predicts Congress I will win only one hundred fifty seats a quarter of the house if the opposition fields single candidates in eighty percent of the races
Analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to unite and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates
The arms kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average Indian voters
In nineteen eighty six India signed a one point four billion dollars contract with A. B. Bofors a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden A. B. to purchase four hundred artillery pieces
The contract was negotiated by the countries ' two prime ministers and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents ' costs
In April nineteen eighty seven evidence surfaced that commissions were paid
The opposition charged that the money was used to bribe Indian government officials an allegation denied by Mr. Gandhi 's administration
But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence
The scandal has faded and flared but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages and that has helped galvanize the opposition which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills
It was the first time in twenty years that such government bills were defeated
In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone a job and even into a school the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government
That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power
His term has produced no spectacular failures in politics in the economy or on the military front and has chalked up some successes
But the average Indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt
His failures in those two areas deeply and sometimes bitterly disappointed many Indians
We do n't like the Congress I says Sooraji Jath a farmer in the western state of Gujarat
The Congress government is taking the farmers ' bread and not giving us any support
When there are well problems light problems road problems the government tells us to forget it
The greatest thing going for Mr. Gandhi and the Congress I Party is the poor reputation of the opposition
Even if it unites for the elections its coherence is likely to be temporary
When the Congress I lost the nineteen seventy seven election following Mrs. Gandhi 's hated emergency rule a similar coalition took power and then disintegrated
Many Indians fear a repeat of that experience
March twenty fourth nineteen eighty six
In nineteen eighty five Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in his talks with then Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme imposed the condition that the contract have no middlemen
April sixteenth nineteen eighty seven
Swedish National Radio reports that about forty million dollars nearly three percent of the total contract was paid by Bofors as commissions to middlemen
June first nineteen eighty seven
Sweden 's National Audit Bureau releases its report confirming payment of about forty million dollars to unidentified Indians
The report says that investigations were severely hampered by lack of cooperation from Bofors
Bofors says it ca n't disclose the names of the middlemen because it would jeopardize industrial confidentiality
A portion of the report containing names of the middlemen is withheld by officials citing bank secrecy requirements
August sixth nineteen eighty seven
Prime Minister Gandhi tells the Indian Parliament neither I nor any member of my family has received any consideration in these transactions
That is the truth
August twenty sixth nineteen eighty seven
Bofors admits payments of forty one million dollars to middlemen
April twenty second nineteen eighty eight
The Hindu newspaper publishes facsimiles of bank documents for foreign exchange remittances and letters between Bofors and certain private companies related to the sale of the guns to India
April twenty sixth nineteen eighty eight
A parliamentary investigative committee dominated by the Congress I Party concludes that there were no middlemen in the deal and no payment to any Indian individual or company
July eighteenth nineteen eighty nine
The comptroller and auditor general of India reports serious lapses in the government 's technical and financial evaluation of the Bofors deal
September fifteenth nineteen eighty nine
Retired army Chief of Staff Krishnaswami Sundarji discloses in an interview that he suggested in May nineteen eighty seven that the government cancel the Bofors contract
According to General Sundarji that would have forced Bofors to disclose the names of the middlemen who received kickbacks from the company
His recommendation was rejected by the government
October ninth nineteen eighty nine
The Hindu newspaper publishes the withheld portion of the Swedish National Audit Bureau 's report
The disclosures state that commissions were paid by Bofors to an Indian agent of the arms company
Parsow Partnership Limited and Elkhorn Partners L. P. said they may seek proposals from third parties relating to a sale or restructuring of C. A. C. I. International Incorporated
C. A. C. I. based in Arlington Virginia said it had n't seen the filing by Parsow and Elkhorn and therefore had no comment
The partnerships said they may seek board representation and they may seek the support of C. A. C. I. 's board and other major shareholders in connection with their plans
According to the filing Parsow and Elkhorn are based in Elkhorn Nebraska and are controlled by the same general partner Alan S. Parsow
Additional shares may be bought or sold in the open market in private transactions or otherwise depending on market conditions and other factors
The inverse trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted yesterday as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices
But bond investors continue to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market
In early trading investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that Friday 's stock market debacle would be repeated
But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average which had been down more than sixty points in midmorning dashed those expectations
Treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a four billion dollars offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt
Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall said Roger Early a vice president at Federated Investors Incorporated Pittsburgh
When stocks stabilized that was a disappointment
Meanwhile for the second straight day the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve 's open market operations
Fed officials injected more cash into the banking system by arranging one point five billion dollars of repurchase agreements during the usual pre noon intervention period
The move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence
The intervention has been friendly meaning that they really did n't have to do it said Maria Fiorini Ramirez money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated
She said a more aggressive move was n't needed
The Fed also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further
It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline a quarter percentage point to about eight and three quarters percent from its previous target level of about nine percent
The rate which banks charge each other on overnight loans is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy
It ended at about eight and eleven sixteenths percent yesterday but was as low as eight and a half percent Monday
The Treasury 's benchmark thirty year bond fell more than a half point or over five dollars for each one thousand dollars face amount while the yield moved above eight percent for the first time since Thursday
Investment grade corporate municipal and mortgage backed securities also fell
But most junk bonds closed unchanged after opening slightly higher on bargain hunting by institutional investors
Some so called high quality junk issues such as R. H. Macy & Company 's fourteen and a half percent subordinated debentures rose
The Macy 's issue closed up about one point at a bid price of ninety seven
The T. V. A. 's public debt offering was its first in fifteen years
Strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from three billion dollars
Traders said hedging related to the T. V. A. pricing also pressured Treasury bonds
Underwriters of the T. V. A. bonds reduced their market risk by selling Treasurys to cover at least part of their T. V. A. holdings said James R. Capra a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Incorporated
The T. V. A. bonds also served to remind the market that there will be even more new supply said Lawrence N. Leuzzi a managing director at S. G. Warburg Securities & Co
Today the Treasury will announce the size of its next two year note sale and Resolution Funding Corporation will announce details of its first bond offering
Some traders estimate nine point seven five billion dollars of new two year Treasurys will be sold next week and they expect Refcorp to offer four billion to six billion dollars of long term bailout bonds
Refcorp was created to help fund the thrift bailout
Another agency issue came to market yesterday
The August gap was expected to have expanded to nine point one billion dollars
Treasury Securities
Treasury securities were essentially flat to about a half point lower
The latest ten year notes were quoted late at ninety nine and twenty five thirty seconds to yield eight point oh one percent compared with one hundred and one thirty second to yield seven point nine seven percent
Short term rates increased
The discount rate on three month bills rose to seven point five two percent for a bond equivalent yield of seven point seven five percent
The rate on six month bills rose to seven point five three percent for a bond equivalent yield of seven point nine two percent
Corporate Other Issues
Investment grade corporate bonds ended a quarter to a half point lower while most junk bonds ended unchanged
The T. V. A. 's huge four billion dollars offering dominated attention in the new issue market
The T. V. A. which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems is a corporation wholly owned by the U. S. government
Yesterday 's bond sale was part of a six point seven billion dollars refinancing plan to pay off high interest debt the T. V. A. owes the Federal Financing Bank an arm of the Treasury
Meanwhile Lockheed Corporation priced a three hundred million dollars note offering to yield nine point three nine percent
Mortgage Backed Securities
The derivative mortgage backed market revived after a brief hiatus as two new Remics totaling eight hundred fifty million dollars were offered and talk circulated about two more issues that could be priced today
The revival of the real estate mortgage investment conduit market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after two days of volatile trading
Dealers noted that it 's difficult to structure new Remics when prices are moving widely
The two Remics priced were a five hundred million dollars Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation issue underwritten by Salomon Brothers Incorporated and a three hundred fifty million dollars Federal National Mortgage Association deal underwritten by Greenwich Capital Markets
The Remic issuance supported prices of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities which held up better than Government National Mortgage Association securities during an afternoon sell off
Freddie Mac nine percent securities were at ninety seven and five thirty seconds down three thirty seconds
The Ginnie Mae nine percent issue was yielding nine point four three percent to a twelve year average life assumption as the spread above the Treasury ten year note held at one point four two percentage points
Municipals
Confusion over the near term trend for rates dominated the municipal arena as gyrations in the stock market continued to buffet bonds
Long tax exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to three eighths point lower after a whipsaw session of moving inversely to stocks in modest dealer led trading
Prices of pre refunded municipal bonds were capped by news that Chemical Securities Incorporated as agent for a customer will accept bids today for two large lists of bonds that include many such issues
The lists total six hundred fifty four point five million dollars
Pre refunded bonds are called at their earliest call date with the escrowed proceeds of another bond issue
Meanwhile several new issues were priced
Underwriters led by PaineWebber Incorporated set preliminary pricing for one hundred forty four point four million dollars of California Health Facilities Financing Authority revenue bonds for Kaiser Permanente
Tentative reoffering yields were set from six point two five percent in nineteen ninety three to seven point two two seven percent in two thousand eighteen
A Chemical Securities group won a one hundred million dollars Oregon general obligation veterans ' tax note issue due November first nineteen ninety
The six and three quarters percent notes yield six point two five percent
Foreign Bonds
West German government bond prices took a wild roller coaster ride pulled down by Monday 's U. S. stock market gains then up by a wider than expected U. S. trade deficit and falling U. S. stock prices
West Germany 's seven percent bond due October nineteen ninety nine was at ninety nine point nine five late yesterday off zero point one zero point from Monday to yield seven point oh one percent
The six and three quarters percent notes due April nineteen ninety four were up zero point one zero point to ninety seven point eight five to yield seven point three one percent
British government bonds surged on renewed volatility in the stock market
The Treasury eleven and three quarters percent bond due two thousand three two thousand sevenths rose twenty three thirty seconds to one hundred twelve and ten thirty seconds to yield ten point oh three percent
But Japanese bonds ended weaker
The benchmark Number one hundred eleven four point six percent bond due nineteen ninety eight ended on brokers ' screens at a price of ninety six off zero point one five point to yield five point two seven percent
A House Senate conference approved an estimated sixty seven billion dollars fiscal nineteen ninety spending bill that provides a twenty eight percent increase for space research and development and incorporates far reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market
The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to one hundred twenty four thousand eight hundred seventy five dollars
Separately the bill gives authority to the Bush administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low income and moderate income homeowners
The second provision affecting so called two hundred thirty five mortgages has met strong opposition from investment bankers represented by the Public Securities Association
And a squad of influential former Senate aides employed by the Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers came to the Capitol in a vain attempt to strip the provision
By an eleven two margin Senate negotiators voted to preserve the two hundred thirty five mortgage refinancing plan and despite powerful allies the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives
This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere and conservative Senator Phil Gramm cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests
We are stewards here not of the mortgage companies but the taxpayers said the Texas Republican
The action came as the administration won final congressional approval of nine million dollars in assistance for elections scheduled in Nicaragua in February
The bulk of the money would be funneled through the National Endowment for Democracy but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money 's true purpose and its ultimate destination
Final approval on a sixty four thirty five roll call was never in doubt but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators including Republicans Jesse Helms and Warren Rudman and Democrats Bill Bradley and John Glenn
The money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring but more than half is likely to go to the Union Nacional Opositora party
Within the appropriations conference yesterday the sixty seven billion dollars measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science housing veterans and the environment
The decision to raise the ceiling on F. H. A. home loans still faces strong opposition in the House
But it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various bookkeeping devices to juggle as much as one billion dollars in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget
These costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal nineteen ninety one and the measure further commits Congress to a set of costly projects including the first construction funds for the space station
Similarly the House agreed to add back sixty two million dollars to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite being developed by General Electric Co
Among major domestic agencies the Environmental Protection Agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by fourteen percent to about eight hundred twenty nine point nine million dollars
To an unusual degree the massive bill has become a vehicle for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states
While the practice was discouraged in the past the conference agreement is laced with veterans ' hospitals environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities
Yesterday 's conference agreement is the second major bill to emerge from negotiations this week as appropriators approved a fiscal nineteen ninety transportation bill late Monday that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights
An exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to Hawaii and Alaska but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate all but about thirty flights would be covered
Separately a third conference report covering an eighteen point four billion dollars Treasury and Postal Service bill was sent to the Senate after passing the House on a three hundred eighty three thirty roll call yesterday
And after weeks of delay the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape
Defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration 's standpoint
And among domestic programs the most serious threat is White House opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the District of Columbia and Department of Health and Human Services
The same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate and Mr. Bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves Senate passed provisions renewing U. S. support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities
In a sharply written letter Representative David Obey chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations warned Mr. Bush that the result of his ultimatum could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere
Markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge
The settlement prices of the December February and April gold contracts were even with Monday 's final prices
The December nineteen eighty nine contract which has the greatest trading volume ended at three hundred seventy one dollars and twenty cents an ounce
The other months posted advances of ten cents to twenty cents an ounce
Yesterday gold traded within a narrow range
Gold tried to rally on Monday but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more than a year selling by gold producers who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold
December delivery gold is trading in a range of three hundred sixty five to three hundred seventy five dollars an ounce and is having difficulty breaking out above that Mr. Savaiko said
Producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold
Also Mr. Savaiko noted stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive
Jeffrey Nichols president of A. P. M. S. Canada Toronto precious metals advisers said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal
Investors in the U. S. and Europe are comfortable with the actions of the Federal Reserve in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system which helped the stock market rebound on Monday he said
There is n't any rush on the part of investors in the West to buy gold he said
They still bear the memory of October nineteen eighty seven when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell Mr. Nichols said
It 's an experience they do n't want to repeat
At the moment gold traders are n't concerned about inflation he said and as for the dollar gold 's association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on gold
There is little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher it may be just a false alarm
This is keeping the gold traders handcuffed
The most remarkable feature about yesterday 's action was that the price of roughly three hundred seventy dollars an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold Mr. Mehta said
Previously he noted gold producers tended to back off from a rising gold market letting prices rise as much as possible before selling
Mr. Mehta observed that the U. S. merchandise trade deficit which rose sharply in August according to yesterday 's report has been having less and less impact on the gold market
The dollar has n't reacted much to it so gold has n't either he said
In other commodity markets yesterday
ENERGY
Crude oil prices rose slightly in lackluster activity as traders in the pits tried to assess action in the stock market
Since stock market indexes plummeted last Friday participants in all markets have been wary
When traders become confident that the stock market has stabilized oil prices are expected to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once again become the major consideration
Crude oil for November delivery edged up by sixteen cents a barrel to twenty dollars and seventy five cents a barrel
Heating oil prices also rose
November gasoline slipped slightly
SUGAR
Futures prices rose on a report that Cuba may seek to postpone some sugar shipments
The March contract advanced zero point one four cent a pound to fourteen point one one cents
According to an analyst Cuba ca n't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked Japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year into early next year
Japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar the analyst said
It was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices the analyst said
Another analyst noted that Cuba has been deferring shipments in recent years
To the professionals in the trade it did n't cause much surprise
The March futures contract traded as high as fourteen point two four cents but could n't sustain the advance he said
LIVESTOCK AND MEATS
The prices of cattle hogs and pork belly futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the Friday stock market plunge would chill consumer spending which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork
The prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply Monday
Cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS
Traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible U. S. soybean sales because U. S. exports are lagging
Since September first about thirteen million fewer bushels of U. S. soybeans have been sold overseas than for the same period last year
Corn futures prices rose slightly while wheat prices settled mixed
Moody 's Investors Service Incorporated fretting about increasing competitive pressure on Ryder placed about two point eight billion dollars in company securities under review for possible downgrade
Ratings under review are Ryder 's A. one collateral trust debentures A. two senior notes and bonds A. two preferred stock and the company 's Prime one rating for commercial paper
Moody 's said it is assessing the strategies Ryder 's management may follow in addressing significant challenges in some major markets
The rating agency said it is focusing especially on the transportation service company 's efforts to control costs improve margins and enhance its competitive position in its primary business vehicle leasing and rental
The nations of southern Africa know a lot about managing elephants their herds are thriving
But the nations of Europe and North America have decided they know better
At this week 's U. N. conference in Lausanne they imposed a global ivory ban that seeks to overturn local policies
A Zimbabwean delegate argued that the ban would guarantee the extinction of the elephant
Legitimate ranchers who have an interest in preserving the herds would go out of business
Poachers would control the underground trade
Many delegates were willing to craft a compromise but U. S. delegate Constance Harriman and others thundered that down
The Greens from the First World wanted a morality play not a negotiation
Fortunately the nations of southern Africa have n't totally surrendered their sovereignty
Five countries announced they would not honor what one Zimbabwean delegate wryly called the made in Switzerland solution
In fact they seemed a mite resentful
The director of Zimbabwe 's Wildlife Department described American conservationists as fat little puppies from urban environments who do n't know a thing about Africa
That 's not fair they 're not all fat
HUGO'S BLAST generates pleas for aid from South Carolina small businesses
The Small Business Administration has received more than five thousand formal requests for disaster loans because of the hurricane
About forty five percent of requests for S. B. A. relief loans which also are available to homeowners come from small businesses compared with a twenty five percent business share after most disasters
The S. B. A. expects to make about one billion dollars in Hurricane Hugo loans
The disaster fund is replenished by loan repayments
Hardest hit by Hugo in South Carolina were small retailers tied to the tourist industry and businesses in agriculture and cultivated seafood
The State Development Board set up a Hugo Hotline to accept business to business help
After N. B. C. weather man Willard Scott broadcast the hot line number it was flooded with ten thousand calls
Last week the U. S. Chamber of Commerce began using its national T. V. show to seek help such as equipment for business owners
Local bankers and accountants help applicants fill out forms
It helps us and people feel better talking to someone who 's gone through the same thing an S. B. A. official says
HEALTH BENEFITS remain a central lobbying effort even as Section eighty nine fades
The Senate after deleting Section eighty nine repeal from its deficit reduction bill still is expected to join the House in voting to kill the law which forces companies to provide comparable benefits to laborers and executives alike
And the group will urge that the federal government pre empt state rules on what must be covered by employers ' health insurance
Small business groups also will fight the medical leave provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves
And they still oppose as too costly an employer paid health insurance bill sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy D. Mass despite his proposal to phase in small business only gradually
There is also worry that the Pepper Commission studying long term health care will again push lawmakers toward employerpaid solutions
The Section eighty nine victory could have a downside by making it harder to oppose lawmakers on other health proposals
With the repeal of Section eighty nine we can no longer say they 're discouraging businesses from offering health plans says Christine Russell the Chamber of Commerce 's small business advocate
JUMPING THE GUN
Even though the announcement was true in the end it was issued without the senator 's permission
I blew it Mr. Motley says apologetically
It was a timing mistake
PRISON SHOP BLUES
Senator Strom Thurmond R. S. C. protests pending legislation to end the preference that the federal prison system gets in selling prisoner made furniture and other goods to government agencies
Small business suppliers want prisons to stop getting high priority especially as prison production grows with swelling inmate populations
Last year the prisons ' sales to the Pentagon totaled three hundred thirty six million dollars
REPAIR SHOPS SCRAP for more access to work on auto emissions systems
Groups representing some independent auto repair shops join a compromise on the Clean Air legislation worked out between environmentalists and Representative Henry Waxman D. Calif
The plan would increase the warranty on auto emission systems to eight years or eighty thousand miles from five years or fifty thousand for major parts
But the warranty on simpler parts would be lowered to two years or twenty four thousand miles
The garage owners say they would benefit because car owners would be less likely to go back to dealers for the simpler repairs after two years
The repair shops are n't united however
Shops represented by the Automotive Service Industry Association and the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association oppose any increase in warranty length
They say the longer the warranty the longer customers will automatically return to new car dealers which then find non warranty work that might otherwise go to repair shops
The House Energy Committee will debate the issue later this month
Stan Hathcock an Atlanta garage owner who opposes a longer warranty estimates that the current plan costs him as much as fifteen thousand dollars a year in lost business

Banc One Corporation said Frank E. McKinney plans to retire as the bank holding company 's president effective January twelfth
Banc One said it is contemplated that John B. McCoy chairman and chief executive officer will assume the additional position of president upon Mr. McKinney 's retirement
Mr. McKinney fifty years old was chairman and chief executive of American Fletcher Corporation Indianapolis when that bank holding company merged into Banc One in January nineteen eighty seven
The company said Mr. McKinney plans to retire because the process of affiliating American Fletcher into Banc One is considered completed
Mr. McKinney will continue as chairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee of Banc One Indiana Corporation the successor company to American Fletcher Corporation but will no longer be active in day to day management
He will remain on the Banc One board

Moody 's Investors Service Incorporated said it lowered ratings on about six hundred fifty million dollars of Beatrice Company debt citing the closely held Chicago food concern 's proposed recapitalization
The ratings concern said it downgraded Beatrice notes Euronotes and certain industrial revenue bonds to single B. one from Ba three and the company 's subordinated debentures to single B. three from single B. two
Moody 's said the proposed recaptilization may limit the company 's ability to realize its profit potential and that paying dividends from a new series of preferred could squeeze basic business operations

When the Soviets announced their last soldier had left Afghanistan in February the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria
It was the Soviets ' Vietnam
The Kabul regime would fall
Millions of refugees would rush home
A resistance government would walk into Kabul
Those who bought that illusion are now bewildered
But there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily
Soviet leaders said they would support their Kabul clients by all means necessary and did
The U. S. said it would fully support the resistance and did n't
With the February nineteen eighty seven U. N. accords relating to Afghanistan the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control
The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind including the return of Soviet ground forces while requiring the U. S. and Pakistan to cut off aid
The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last minute addition of a unilateral American caveat that U. S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did
But as soon as the accords were signed American officials sharply reduced aid
In February nineteen eighty nine when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout the U. S. cut it further
Not so the Soviets
General Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than one billion dollars of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime
Since the troop withdrawal Moscow has poured in an additional two hundred to three hundred million dollars worth per month nearly two billion dollars since February equivalent to the total U. S. aid to the resistance in nine years
This includes what Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov fetchingly called new peaceful long range weapons including more than eight hundred SCUD missiles
By early May Moscow had delivered for example one thousand trucks about one hundred tanks artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles
Later that month it added an entire tank brigade including one hundred twenty T. seventy two tanks and more than forty B. M. P. state of the art infantry fighting vehicles
By September a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional three hundred combat vehicles one thousand more trucks and ten thousand Soviet trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar
Moscow claims this is all needed to protect the Kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance
It is well known that the regular Afghan infantry is filled with reluctant conscripts
But this is not the entire Afghan army and it is no longer Kabul 's only military force
Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the U. S. S. R. and other East bloc nations thirty thousand to forty thousand of these troops have returned
Even if not all these forces are committed to the regime they are now dependent on it
And thousands of Afghan children have been taken to the Soviet Union where they are hostage for the behavior of their families
Since nineteen eighty one Indian military advisers have been assisting the Kabul regime
In preparation for the withdrawal Moscow Kabul and New Delhi signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel
Cuban military personnel also have been active in Afghanistan since nineteen seventy nine
The Soviets cut a deal with Iran a future Iranian role in Afghanistan in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy
The deal was symbolized by the restoration of the Shi'ite Sultan Ali Keshtmand to the Afghan prime ministry
Moreover serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces
Before his assassination in nineteen eighty eight President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn
Representative Bill McCollum R. Florida reports that these included twenty thousand to thirty thousand Soviet Central Asian K. G. B. Border Guards ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms
Meanwhile the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody minded fanatics
In this they are aided by years of American European Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public
This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better moderate leaders
In autumn last year for example the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates
At the last minute however Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces
The deal fell through and Kandahar remains a major regime base
The resistance lacks not only air power armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps mine detectors or even winter gloves
Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime
Instead they were pressured by Pakistan 's I. S. I. the channel for their support into attacking Jalalabad
They took more than twenty five percent casualties journalists report that they faced minefields without mine detectors
The wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the Kabul regime but that it continues to exist and fight at all
For months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack
Thus far there is no indication that they have been re supplied with Stingers or other anti aircraft weapons
Indeed U. S. officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year
Moscow and Kabul must have found that information useful
For a decade U. S. policy has been incoherent based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf
No settlement negotiated by others can force the Afghan people to give up their struggle
A cutoff of U. S. military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain
Creation of a new realistic U. S. policy is long overdue

Nothing stirred the soul of Ronald Reagan and his disciples as much as the crusade to aid Nicaragua 's Contra rebels or the dream of building a space based defense shield to knock out Soviet nuclear missiles
Yet under Mr. Reagan 's preferred successor President Bush those two cherished national security causes are withering on the vine
And surprisingly little more than a whimper of protest is being heard even though Reaganauts once breathed fire supporting the Contras and the Strategic Defense Initiative
The programs have arthritis says Representative Henry Hyde a conservative Republican from Illinois
Yet he asserts you look around and you say Who are the leaders
Who is going to carry the water
It is n't surprising that President Bush has n't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or S. D. I.
Though he nominally supports both programs Mr. Bush has n't been a passionate champion of either cause as Mr. Reagan was
What 's surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative outcry as the Bush administration lets the programs slip down the national priority list
A combination of factors a weariness among some conservatives a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues seem to explain the strange tranquility
Above all though conservative Republicans who have championed both the Contras and S. D. I. are reluctant to attack a Republican president for failing to do more though that reluctance may be receding
We want to complain we want to say something about it and we 're going to as it gets worse says Representative Dan Burton an Indiana Republican who has been a staunch Contra backer
But it 's like kicking your father in the pants
You hate to do it because he 's your father
Mr. Burton says conservatives ' unhappiness with Mr. Bush 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in Panama will make them more willing to speak out
Of course neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or S. D. I.
Mr. Bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until Nicaragua holds national elections next February
But the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels
And the administration 's deal with Congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month though the committees are likely to let aid continue until February
Most analysts think there 's little prospect the Contras can be a significant fighting force without U. S. arms and after the February election their future in any form will be murky at best
Instead of focusing on the Contras Mr. Bush has switched to urging members of Congress most recently in a White House meeting yesterday to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua 's Sandinista government
The administration continues to support S. D. I. or Star Wars and it recently lobbied to persuade the Senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program
But the strong pitch by Mr. Cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to S. D. I.
The House has already voted for a deep cut in funding and in the end the program 's backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year
And while the defense secretary is speaking out President Bush himself has n't launched any high visibility campaign to drum up support as President Reagan did
The administration also acknowledges that it is n't pursuing Mr. Reagan 's original vision of an impenetrable shield protecting the whole U. S. but rather a more modest version
More ominous to S. D. I. supporters the Bush administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms control proposal from the Soviet Union that spells long term trouble for Star Wars
The Soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space based defenses
It will be hard down the road to persuade Congress to approve money for S. D. I. plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty
As a result Frank Gaffney a former Reagan Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy charges that the administration 's professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the S. D. I. program strain credulity
In fact because communism seems to be beating a global retreat some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti communist philosophy is prevailing that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs
Some activists are toiling to raise the profile of the two causes
But they say they ca n't make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide
One longtime champion of these programs in Congress Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia is distracted by questions about his ethics conservatives note
Other conservative champions like Wyoming Republican Senator Malcolm Wallop a longtime S. D. I. advocate do n't have the clout with the Bush White House that they enjoyed with President Reagan
Above all though proponents say neither the Contra nor the S. D. I. cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support
For there to be wind in the sails of any program the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails says Representative Burton
All this causes Representative Hyde to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm
What I 'd like to see if he is up to it is for Reagan to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for S. D. I. the congressman says
We 're sorry to report that on Monday President Bush accepted the resignation of William Allen as chairman of the U. S. Civil Rights Commission
Mr. Allen appointed by President Reagan grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies
His recent speech provocatively titled Blacks Animals Homosexuals What is a Minority caused an uproar when its title leaked out
Mr. Allen 's commissioners voted to call his unread speech thoughtless disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory
Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman
Representative Don Edwards the California Democrat warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be outside the scope of the commission 's jurisdiction
Thomas Stoddard head of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund called the prospect of the speech frankly shocking
We 've actually read the speech
Mr. Allen began it with a warning to his hosts a California church group that opposes rights for homosexuals
He said that other participants in the conference do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual but that I mean to persuade you to the opposite view
He recalled to the audience a strange infelicitous analogy he once heard arguing now that we have finally recognized that American blacks have rights we need to do the same for animals
Mr. Allen objected to this analogy because it seems to assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals as a mere project of charity of humaneness
Rights on such a basis whether for blacks or homosexuals are mere indulgences he said subject to being taken back
He says the title of his speech was to make his point that Americans have rights as individuals not as members of certain select groups
His speech criticized the idiocy of notions of protected groups in society as opposed to individual equality or as he put it in a common destiny as Americans
Instead of lobbying for special treatment Mr. Allen said that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk invidious retrenchment with government complicity
This hardly sounds like an anti homosexual screed
What 's really going on here
The three most important things to understand about Mr. Allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual a triple threat to the liberal establishment
Mr. Allen who teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals ' rights
He last made waves when he dared to defend an Indian girl who had been adopted by non Indian parents off her reservation
Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again which somehow elevated the vague concept of Indian rights above the rights of individual Indians
There is a huge divide between Mr. Allen 's we're all in this together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups
Indeed the gap is so large that Mr. Allen 's critics refuse to engage the debate
Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument
Their effort to run him out of Washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement
We hope the next head of the Civil Rights Commission will be as brave as Mr. Allen in making the case for equality of civil rights

Japanese air conditioner maker Daikin Industries Limited was fined two million yen fourteen thousand dollars for exporting to the Soviet Union a chemical solution that could be used in missile guidance systems
A Daikin executive in charge of exports when the high purity halogenated hydrocarbon was sold to the Soviets in nineteen eighty six received a suspended ten month jail sentence
Judge Masaaki Yoneyama told the Osaka District Court Daikin 's responsibility is heavy because illegal exports lowered international trust in Japan
Sale of the solution in concentrated form to Communist countries is prohibited by Japanese law and by international agreement
A Soviet legislative panel rejected as not radical enough a government proposal on decentralizing economic control
The newspaper Leninskoye Zamya said the committee decided the plan to parcel out economic powers previously exercised by Moscow to the country 's fifteen republics does n't reflect the radical changes in the Soviet federation
The committee gave the government until November fifteenth to revise the proposal
The move reflected the growing confidence of the revamped Supreme Soviet
Scott Paper Company said it is abandoning a proposed six hundred fifty million dollars tree farming project in Indonesia because it no longer expects to use as much eucalyptus pulp as previously anticipated
The eucalyptus plantation and pulp mill which would have covered about one hundred seventy five thousand acres in the Irian Jaya region had been approved by Indonesia 's investment board
But it was opposed by some environmentalists as a threat to Irian Jaya 's forests and a potential source of social unrest for the primitive tribes who inhabit them

Polaroid Corporation benefiting from staff reduction savings reported a strong gain in third quarter operating results and net income of twenty nine point nine million dollars or forty cents a share after preferred stock requirements
Analysts said the numbers were better than expectations partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign currency translation
However they said the company 's flat revenue was a disappointment and an indication that sales of Polaroid 's new conventional film in the U. S. have been sluggish
Revenue in the third quarter was four hundred thirty seven point seven million dollars almost unchanged from four hundred thirty six point three million dollars a year earlier
Polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of sixty three point one million dollars for the third quarter more than double the year before twenty four million dollars
Charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of fifty four point one million dollars or seventy seven cents a share in nineteen eighty eight 's third quarter
I 'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand for Polaroid products said Michael Ellmann an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co
If you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue there is n't a lot here to base optimism on
Alex Henderson an analyst with Prudential Bache says Polaroid officials told him yesterday that U. S. sales of the company 's new conventional film product introduced in the second quarter have been disappointing after a promising start
Mr. Yanes said the film One Film is currently carried at about fifteen thousand retail outlets including drugstores and supermarkets
For the nine months Polaroid reported earnings of ninety eight point five million dollars or one dollar and twenty seven cents a share
Last year the company had a nine month loss of fifteen point one million dollars or twenty three cents a share
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Polaroid closed at forty seven dollars up one point one two five dollars
Why is the stock market suddenly so volatile
Yesterday the Dow Jones Industrial Average did a now familiar dance It plunged sixty point two five points before lunch with most of the drop occurring in twenty five minutes
Then it rebounded to finish down only eighteen point six five points
And those swings paled beside Friday 's one hundred ninety point five eight point plunge and Monday 's eighty eight point one two point recovery
It 's madness that in an hour you can whack off so much value says Stanford Calderwood chairman of Trinity Investment Management Corporation Boston
And apparently it is here to stay
Richard Bernstein senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co says My gut feel is that we 'll live with those swings for a while
There are many reasons for the market 's jumpiness new trading vehicles such as stock index futures and options computer driven strategies like program trading and crowd psychology
But most are linked by a single theme liquidity the ability to get in and out of the market quickly
Prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are employing ways to turn over shares at ever faster rates and increasingly acting in concert
Institutions are herding animals says Peter Anderson who heads the pension fund management arm of I. D. S. Financial Services Incorporated
We watch the same indicators and listen to the same prognosticators
Like lemmings we tend to move in the same direction at same time
And that naturally exacerbates price movements
Institutions who now account for most trading count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an eye blink
But when they discover that markets are n't always as liquid as they supposed markets jump
On Monday for instance Howard Ward a principal at Scudder Stevens & Clark found that you could n't buy blue chips at quoted prices without paying up
And when many firms had to pay up Monday 's sudden rally was sparked
Trading in futures and options some people believe can add to volatility
Investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks that is a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks
These and other modern trading methods tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets says George Douglas first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated
It 's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy so that bouts of higher volatility get built into the stock market
One new investment style called asset allocation shifts portfolio weightings between stocks bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive
For instance First Quadrant Corporation an asset allocator based in Morristown N. J. said it quickly boosted stock positions in its aggressive accounts to seventy five percent from fifty five percent to take advantage of plunging prices Friday
It added another five percent Monday before stocks rallied
When they did the firm reduced those stock holdings to about seventy percent
A classic example of institutions ' hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance now widely discredited
Before the nineteen eighty seven crash an estimated sixty billion dollars in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique
The idea was to insure the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves
But in October nineteen eighty seven when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets
Yet even today institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets
Others are doing index arbitrage a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures
Unlike traditional buy and hold strategies all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch
But institutions say Wall Street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets
Brokers do n't deny that
Wall Street traders say that with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the nineteen seventies securities firms ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock
I think everyone 's a little more leery says Jack Baker head of equity trading at Shearon Lehman Hutton Incorporated
The institutions have driven commission rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital says Tom Gallagher senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at Oppenheimer & Co
Why should I risk money for a guy for who 's paying me five cents a dance
All you get is risk
Lack of liquidity can also result from exchange reforms
Many traders say that circuit breakers put in place to damp volatility after the nineteen eighty seven crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged Friday
The circuit breakers caused a thirty minute shutdown in trading in Standard & Poor 's five hundred stock index futures contract as the markets were falling
With the futures trading halt you could only sell stocks to cut exposure to the market says a money manager
It was scary to people thinking that they could n't get their trades off
It was like they put you in a room with a gorilla and told you there were three doors to exit said one Chicago based futures trader
Then they said By the way two of the doors are locked
The takeover mania also adds to volatility
U. A. L. Corporation is a good example
Valued as a buy out target the airline stock was trading at nearly two hundred eighty dollars a share
When the deal ran into trouble the stock tumbled it closed at one hundred ninety eight dollars yesterday
Presumably U. A. L. is now trading closer to its value based on earnings
By contrast traditional buy and hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves
Scott Black a value oriented money manager who heads Delphi Management Incorporated points out that for those who invest on fundamentals the value of a stock from day to day does n't change all that much
Some experts say markets are n't as volatile as widely assumed
Hans Stoll finance professor at Vanderbilt University says the current volatility in U. S. markets pales in comparison to the nineteen thirties decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced
I just ca n't believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility he says
And Robert D. Arnott president of asset allocator First Quadrant notes that before Friday 's tailspin daily volatility on the New York Stock Exchange in recent weeks had reached historically low levels
Some people tend to ignore that a fifty point move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower
John J. Phelan Junior chairman of the Big Board asserts that nineteen eighty eight and nineteen eighty nine have been two of the least volatile years in the last thirty or forty years
But the low average volatility Mr. Phelan is talking about is n't any comfort in a period of rapid stock market moves like the past week
Some people think the search for liquidity is fruitless
In nineteen thirty six John Maynard Keynes wrote that of the maxims of orthodox finance none surely is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity
It leads investors to focus on short term price movements a game of musical chairs he called it rather than on long term fundamental valuation

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti nuclear messages related to its Galileo space probe which is to be launched today
Charles Redmond a NASA spokesman said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected one hundred university centers to be infected by today
Although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either Galileo or the shuttle part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn
Mr. Redmond said the intruder had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared garbage data could be substituted for real data
He estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system
The intruder among the broadest yet to hit a research network appeared to affect only Digital Equipment Corporation hardware that uses Digital 's VAX V. M. S. operating system
It is unrelated to the much publicized virus that last year infected Arpanet a much larger network used by researchers at universities laboratories and government agencies around the world
In the lingo of computer security the NASA intruder is technically a computer worm Mr. Redmond said
A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks
The Galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in France hooked up to NASA 's Space Physics Analysis Network Mr. Redmond said
NASA said the Galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject worms
But Mr. Redmond said the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes
Michael Alexander a senior editor at Computerworld a trade publication said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords such as ones that are the same as the user 's name
If it finds one and gets into the system it will display a screen when a user logs on that says Worms Against Nuclear Killers
You talk of times of peace for all and then prepare for war
In addition Mr. Alexander said the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center such as George Orwell was an optimist or Do n't feed the bats tonight
The worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user
The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running
If it finds one of those passwords Mr. Alexander said the worm will do such things as change users ' passwords to a series of random numbers preventing them from signing on to the network
NASA estimated that on Monday about four computer centers were affected
Yesterday the number grew to forty today the number is expected to grow to one hundred
NASA said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the six thousand connected to Internet were affected and the extent of the damage if any
Anti nuclear activists have protested the launch of the Galileo space probe to Jupiter because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft
So far Galileo has been delayed twice once because of a computer malfunction connected with a space shuttle engine and yesterday because of the weather
NASA said the Galileo worm had nothing to do with either delay
Mr. Alexander of Computerworld said hackers have gone after SPAN before
He said the Chaos Computer Club of West Germany once managed to invade SPAN and do such things as change the value of pi messing up some calculations
It is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought
Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature and not to courts
That 's the conventional theory anyway
In practice however the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur
In particular a common law of white collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade
For example although insider trading has long been criminal it has never been statutorily defined
Gradually however lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point
Consider the facts underlying the nineteen eighty nine conviction of Robert Chestman
Prior to a tender offer by A. & P. for Waldbaum Incorporated in nineteen eighty six the founder of the Waldbaum 's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery
She called her daughter to take her to the bank who in turn persuaded her husband a Mr. Loeb to run this errand
Hearing of this information the husband discussed it with his broker Mr. Chestman and Mr. Chestman then bought for his own account and other clients
Basically Mr. Chestman was a fourth level tippee
Did Mr. Loeb his tipper breach a fiduciary duty and if so to whom
Did Mr. Loeb seek personal gain and if so how
Or did Mr. Chestman only hear a market rumor which one may lawfully trade upon
The line seems awfully thin for criminal law purposes
A second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by Robert Freeman formerly head of arbitrage at Goldman Sachs & Co
Essentially Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy out when he was told by another prominent trader Bernard Bunny Lasker that the deal was in trouble
After placing orders to sell Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel an investment banker at Kidder Peabody & Company who was advising on the deal to confirm these rumors
Mr. Siegel asked Mr. Freeman who his source was and on hearing that it was Bunny Lasker responded Well your bunny has a good nose
The illegal tip of the bunny 's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market
Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced
Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain
Did Mr. Freeman have notice of this
Finally was the information material
Yet all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue Who is and who should be making the criminal law here
It is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness
Arguably both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky
But even if they behaved recklessly reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case by case judicial extension of the law of insider trading
Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors
After the fact judicial examination of an actor 's conduct has always been the common law 's method
When only civil liability is involved this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization
Still case by case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc and usually sleazy examples
Thus a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule
For example in focusing on Mr. Freeman 's attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal 's collapse one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin What if the rumor had been false
Can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly improbable rumor is in fact false
Today after Mr. Freeman 's plea there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient
At least when the stakes are high uncertainty in turn results in overinclusion as individuals do not dare to approach an uncertain line closely
The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white collar crime
In nineteen eighty seven the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v. U. S. to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues
Yet late last year Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services
At a stroke this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee
Such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem Congress finds it is easier to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions which the courts must thereafter interpret than to engage in the difficult line drawing distinctions that are inherently its responsibility
We are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway
Predictably when confronted with morally dubious behavior prosecutors will exploit the latitude such openended statutes give them
Over the long run however sleazy cases will make bad law

Corning 's chairman and chief executive officer James R. Houghton said operating performance continued to be strong in the telecommunications and health and science segments

As for joint ventures Mr. Houghton said profit was essentially flat due primarily to a slow recovery at Samsung Corning Company in Korea following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to China
Also profit was hurt by the strength of the dollar overseas which negatively affected the company 's currency exchange rate
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Corning closed at thirty eight dollars and fifty cents down seventy five cents

Banks are continuing to go after individual investors despite falling interest rates
Yields on small denomination certificates of deposit fell at about half the rate of so called jumbo CDs this week according to Banxquote Money Markets an information service based here
Investors can get slightly higher yields on deposits below fifty thousand dollars than they can on deposits of ninety thousand dollars and up
Banks want to remain competitive said Norberto Mehl chairman of Banxquote
October is a big rollover month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand among people leaving the stock market
Some bankers are reporting more inquiries than usual about CDs since Friday
Reports from branches are that there has been greater interest in the last day or so said Steven Braitman a vice president at Chemical Bank in New York
Chemical said deposits Monday were about five million dollars higher than usual and it expects more activity as investors receive the proceeds from sales of stock
This is no time to be playing in the street
the Dow has more ups and downs than an elevator proclaimed an advertisement Monday in New York newspapers touting Lincoln Savings Bank 's one year C. D.
Harold Jones Lincoln 's chief retail banking officer said there has n't yet been a discernible response although the ad included a coupon that could arrive later in the week
Friday 's market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for C. D. rollovers when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way
First National Bank of Boston for example is offering certain new depositors an extra quarter of a percentage point on six month and twelve month CDs
Some banks actually boosted yields on the shortest term CDs in the latest week
New York 's Citibank for instance increased the yield on small denomination three month CDs to eight percent from seven point nine percent
On average however three month CDs at major banks are yielding a tenth of a percentage point less than they were a week ago
Average yields on CDs aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction
Six month CDs of fifty thousand dollars and less yielded an average eight point oh two percent in the week ended Tuesday down from eight point one zero percent according to Banxquote
The yield on six month T. bills fell to seven point eight two percent on Monday from eight point oh one percent the week before
Meanwhile the average yield on six month CDs of more than ninety thousand dollars fell to seven point nine three percent in the latest week according to Banxquote from eight point one zero percent the week before
Mr. Mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large denomination CDs but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding
CDs sold by major brokerage houses which like jumbo CDs tend to closely follow interest rate trends also posted larger drops in yields
A six month broker sold C. D. for example was yielding an average eight point oh nine percent in the latest week a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before
In late April when interest rates were at their recent highs short term CDs sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks
C. D. yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks
What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit reported yesterday make it unlikely that short term interest rates will rise any time soon said Mr. Mehl of Banxquote
Even before the market drop rates were down about half a percentage point said Robert J. Hutchinson senior vice president for retail marketing at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company in New York
That puts pressure on C. D. rates
Conservatives have an important decision to make this fall
At the recent meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund the Bush administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the I. M. F. 's capital base
This would be consistent with its unwavering support for the Brady Plan and G. seven exchange rate intervention and with its financial commitment to Mexico Poland and others
The I. M. F. has several reasons for requesting the increase
Its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the nineteen seventies
The size and pace of disbursements will accelerate further under the Brady Plan which promises larger and earlier disbursements to approved countries
At least three other factors have encouraged the I. M. F. to insist on increased capital
First it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets for which it feels some responsibility
Second the World Bank 's recent seventy five billion dollars capital increase fourteen billion dollars from the U. S. has left the I. M. F. feeling less than first fiddle among international financial institutions
Third the I. M. F. would like to meet Japan 's request for increased ownership currently four point five percent
Japan has supported a larger role for the I. M. F. in developing country debt issues and is an important financial resource for I. M. F. guided programs in developing countries
While international politics may argue for the capital increase there is a clear economic case against it
Opponents of the increase argue that the I. M. F. practices central planning while supporting ineffective governments
They question whether the I. M. F. has any role in developing countries given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in balance of payments emergencies
Opponents show that there are already more funds available than commendable reform efforts
They worry that new I. M. F. funding of developing countries will simply end up substituting I. M. F. debt for reschedulable commercial bank debt a bad trade all around
They believe microeconomics which addresses the problems of markets investment climate and management practices is the key to developing country growth not the I. M. F. 's Keynesian focus on trade deficits quarterly targets and government debt
They point at the numerous developing country governments that have inflated taxed and regulated themselves into despair under successive I. M. F. programs
Decisions on increases in the I. M. F. 's capital base traditionally are made by the administration with subsequent authorization by Congress
The last U. S. congressional authorization in nineteen eighty three was a political donnybrook and carried a six billion dollars housing program along with it to secure adequate votes
The politics of the nineteen ninety congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous authorizations
Conservative Republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party 's popular president in an election year
A U. S. decision to refuse the I. M. F. its capital increase or limit it to twenty five percent would bring a major change in international economic policy and could not be taken lightly
Commentators would fret over the implications for the G. seven coordination process and the stability of world financial markets
Because commercial banks and the developing country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase a scaled down I. M. F. mission would leave both feeling shortchanged
Furthermore a U. S. rejection of the capital increase and transfer of shares to Japan would give Japan an argument against future calls for economic burden sharing
On the other hand a decision to increase the I. M. F. 's capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries
With the increase even more developing country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate I. M. F. approved economic plans
Upping the ante could slow economic development even further as countries delay market opening steps in anticipation of richer multilateral support
Conservatives should take a position prior to the administration 's year end deadline
The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase rather than its purpose
If conservatives do n't support an increase in the I. M. F. 's capital then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making prearranged trades with each other that allegedly cheated a customer
Merc officials said Gary N. Roberts was disciplined following the exchange 's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from July to November nineteen eighty eight
The Merc said Mr. Roberts withheld from the market certain orders in cooperation with another trader David Stein
The Merc fined Mr. Roberts fifteen thousand dollars and suspended his trading membership for three years
Also he and Mr. Stein were ordered to make restitution of thirty five thousand dollars to a customer
Mr. Stein was fined twenty five thousand dollars and suspended for three years
Messrs. Roberts and Stein could n't be reached for comment
The Merc said that as part of the disciplinary settlement neither man admitted nor denied the alleged violations
Neither was among the forty six traders indicted last August in a federal investigation of traders at both the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade
The purchase comes after nearly three years of on again off again talks between T. C. I. and Viacom which has also discussed the sale of an interest in Showtime with other cable operators
But T. C. I. President John Malone has long been concerned about H. B. O. 's dominance of the pay T. V. business and has been eager to keep Showtime as a healthy competitor
It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay television marketplace Mr. Malone said in a statement
In a telephone interview Robert Thomson T. C. I. senior vice president said Showtime 's suit against H. B. O. does n't involve us and nothing we 're doing here bears any relationship to that
He added We do n't intend to be drawn into it noting that T. C. I. wo n't play any active role in the management of Showtime
Linking up Showtime with the largest cable operator in the U. S. could sharply boost its subscribers
T. C. I. said it may bring in other cable operators as investors a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks such as The Discovery Channel
Additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further
Time Warner declined comment
In addition to owning H. B. O. Time Warner owns American Television & Communications Incorporated the nation 's second largest cable operator after T. C. I.
Viacom also owns cable systems but it is the fourteenth largest operator of such systems with less than one million subscribers
The T. C. I. investment is a big victory for Viacom 's chief executive officer Frank Biondi and Winston H. Cox president of the Showtime unit
This takes any question of Showtime 's viability and puts it away once and for all Mr. Biondi said in a telephone interview
The fight between H. B. O. and Showtime is particularly acrimonious because Mr. Biondi is the former chief executive of H. B. O. and Mr. Cox served as chief of marketing for the service
They were both hired by Sumner Redstone the Boston billionaire who took control of Viacom three years ago in a leveraged buy out
Time Warner has vigorously denied all of Viacom 's allegations
Boeing Company already struck by its Machinists union briefly called off contract talks with its engineers and labeled their demands grossly excessive
Later however the company agreed to meet on Monday with the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association after a federal mediator intervened according to the union
A spokesman for the engineers said the company asked the union to reduce its demands which included a nineteen percent pay hike in the first year and eight percent in the second and third years
The union represents about twenty eight thousand engineers and technical workers
Its contract expires December first
Meanwhile a federal mediator is scheduled to meet today with Boeing officials and representatives of fifty five thousand striking Machinists
It will take several meetings to resolve this said a spokesman for the Machinists union
We do n't want to bring back something the members will reject
Machinists already have rejected a package that would have provided a ten percent pay raise plus bonuses over the three year life of the contract
It also would have reduced mandatory overtime
Investor Asher Edelman increased his stake in Intelogic Trace Incorporated and cleared the way for additional purchases
It was n't clear however whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint Corporation a San Antonio Texas based data processing systems maker
Intelogic Trace a computer services company was spun off to Datapoint holders in nineteen eighty five after Mr. Edelman gained control
After Mr. Ackerman announced he was soliciting consents from shareholders in order to wrest control of Datapoint from Mr. Edelman the corporate raider purchased thirty percent of Datapoint 's shares
The purchases increased his stake to sixteen point two percent of the shares outstanding
The filing also said certain provisions which apply to persons acquiring twenty percent or more of Intelogic common stock were waived by Intelogic for Mr. Edelman who is chairman of the company
Mr. Edelman could n't be reached for comment
The federal government should make free voluntary testing for the AIDS virus the cornerstone of an expanded campaign to stop the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome the Hudson Institute recommended
By encouraging massive routine voluntary testing we can enable society to voluntarily segregate itself sexually into two groups those who carry the virus and those who do not the Indianapolis research organization said in a new report
The report takes a more alarmed view of AIDS and recommends a more sweeping response than many other analyses
It warns that the AIDS epidemic may reduce the rate of growth of the work force curb productivity gains and slow economic growth
It contends that current government policy is failing to stem the AIDS epidemic because it suggests the use of condoms can make sex safe
But the report says The only safe sex is sex between uninfected partners and testing is the only way to learn of infection
Hudson 's researchers estimated that it would cost less than six hundred fifty million dollars a year to test the entire population between the ages of twelve and sixty five years old
In addition the report recommends that federal and state governments provide free treatment to all who test positive
An unexpectedly sharp widening in the U. S. trade gap for August dragged the dollar lower Tuesday but profit taking on short positions helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts
While the market kept careful tabs on Wall Street 's gyrations it shrugged off a modest downturn in equities to bid the dollar well above the day 's lows
Soon after the release of the U. S. trade figures the dollar plunged to an intraday low of one hundred forty point nine five yen
It also declined against the mark but did n't reach its intraday low of one point eight four three five marks until two hours later
The unit stabilized about midday New York time at around one point eight five marks and one hundred forty one yen prompting unconfirmed rumors that the U. S. Federal Reserve had intervened to blunt the unit 's tumble
The dollar finished at its intraday highs
Dealers noted that the foreign exchange market 's initial bearish reaction to the U. S. trade figures was tempered later by a calmer reassessment of the data
The U. S. Commerce Department reported a ten point seven seven billion dollars deficit in August compared with a revised July deficit of eight point two four billion dollars
Economists had expected a nine point one billion dollars gap
The August figure reflected a six point four percent rise in imports and a zero point two percent drop in exports
He said that while the U. S. trade gap with Canada has widened significantly the trade deficit with Western Europe and Japan continues to narrow
And he added that manufactured goods exports are still rising

They say that the recent injection of liquidity into the U. S. banking system has been modest and they do n't anticipate significant easing by the U. S. Federal Reserve
The Fed arranged one point five billion dollars of customer repurchase agreements Tuesday the second repurchase agreement in two days
The move which injects capital into the system is seen as an effort to reassure the finanicial markets that the U. S. central bank is ready to provide the ample liquidity
But other analysts contend that while the Fed 's move to loosen credit has n't been aggressive it nevertheless sends a clear signal that at least for now the Fed has relaxed its grip on credit
They add that the Fed has allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about eight and five eighths percent from its levels of just below nine percent last week
The federal funds rate is the overnight lending rate that banks charge each other
Market participants said that the mark continues to post the most significant gains against the dollar

President Bush will veto a bill funding the Departments of Labor Education and Health and Human Services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest the White House said
Mr. Bush had threatened a veto previously
But he put off a firm decision while his aides and legislators searched for a compromise that would tighten requirements for such abortions in a way acceptable to the president
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said negotiations between Bush aides and lawmakers ended Monday without success
Most lawmakers think it will be extremely difficult for Mr. Bush 's opponents on the abortion issue to round up the votes needed to override the veto
But there still may be prolonged debate and political maneuvering that holds up the one hundred fifty six point seven billion dollars funding bill for the fiscal year that began October first
Mr. Bush has said he personally approves of abortions in the cases of rape incest and danger to the life of the mother
But he has opposed Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women who say they are victims of rape and incest arguing that those exceptions are enforced so loosely that they open the way for abortions for other women

An experimental vaccine can alter the immune response of people infected with the AIDS virus a prominent U. S. scientist said
However that does n't mean they can benefit from the vaccine
Its effectiveness ca n't be determined until a large clinical trial is undertaken by the Army in January according to Robert Redfield chief of acquired immune deficiency syndrome research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
Doctor Redfield 's report on early experiments using an AIDS vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Incorporated of West Haven Connecticut came at a meeting of AIDS vaccine researchers in Florida late Monday
The vaccine VaxSyn H. I. V. one has been safely given to fourteen people some of whom are experiencing substantial increases in certain antibodies
The conventional wisdom used to be that you could n't modify the immune response of an infected individual by innoculating them with synthetic viral proteins Doctor Redfield said
We 've demonstrated that you can
He said certain volunteers developed kinds of antibodies associated with early AIDS
Other antibodies sparked by the preparation are of a sort rarely present in large quantities in infected or ill individuals he added
One of the mysteries of AIDS remains why infected people produce large quantities of antibodies but deteriorate nonetheless

Representative Lee Hamilton D. Ind said he and Representative Byron Dorgan D. N. D. are backing away from their proposal to make the Treasury Secretary a voting member of the Federal Reserve panel that sets monetary policy
The original bill was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank 's independence
Fed critics however hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy
Representative Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed

Spooked investors despite their stampede to dump takeover stocks should hold on tight to their Jaguar shares
That 's the view of some analysts here who argue that Britain 's leading maker of luxury cars still may have two U. S. auto giants battling for it
Yesterday Ford Motor disclosed that it has raised its holding in Jaguar to ten point four percent from five percent
Both Ford and its rival General Motors recently set their sights on grabbing significant minority stakes in the British company
Ford 's latest move increases the pressure on G. M. to complete its current talks with Jaguar quickly
G. M. is likely to reach the cooperative operating pact it has been seeking in about two weeks knowledgeable individuals say
At that point investors may face a long bumpy ride
A victor in the fight for Jaguar may not emerge until after the expiration late next year of British government takeover restrictions
The curbs prevent a buyer from purchasing more than fifteen percent of Jaguar shares without permission
This is an exceptionally odd takeover battle says London analyst Christopher Will of Shearson Lehman Hutton
Jaguar 's American depositary receipts were up three eighths yesterday in a down market closing at ten and three eighths
Jaguar 's ADRs make the company one of the most widely held United Kingdom stocks in the U. S. with more than one fourth of its shares owned there
Jaguar topped the most active list for the U. S. over the counter market Monday
And on London 's Stock Exchange Monday eighteen point five million shares were traded far above the usual volume
Ford 's share purchases undoubtedly accounted for much of Monday 's heavy trading
Last week many Jaguar shareholders took their money and ran
Fears that Ford 's ardor might be cooling put Jaguar shares into reverse after G. M. confirmed its friendly negotiations with Jaguar
But yesterday 's announcement indicates that Ford has n't lost interest
Both Shearson 's Mr Will and Stephen Reitman European auto analyst at the London brokerage firm U. B. S. Phillips & Drew recently switched their Jaguar recommendations to hold from buy
Sit tight through the coming volatility Mr. Reitman suggests though he concedes that many small investors will find Jaguar 's zigzags too hard to swallow
But a crucial point is how Ford reacts when G. M. the world 's largest auto maker firms up its proposed deal with Jaguar
At the moment Ford executives will say little beyond reiterating their desire to raise Ford 's Jaguar stake to about fifteen percent
G. M. is expected to inject roughly two hundred million pounds three hundred sixteen million dollars by acquiring some Jaguar shares and then win Jaguar management 's promise of an eventual thirty percent stake
Analysts believe the car makers also will create joint ventures to develop new executive models doubling Jaguar 's yearly output of fifty thousand cars
Jaguar shareholders would have to bless such a far reaching accord
Ford might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the U. K. government agreed to drop the anti takeover barrier early
I think Ford is going to come out with full guns blazing Mr. Reitman says
Ford wants Jaguar very much
U. S. takeover stock speculators who may own between twenty percent and thirty percent of Jaguar could give Ford enough votes to block the G. M. deal
G. M. might counterbid
Then Mr Will says you get a bidding war between two very rich very determined international companies
He believes Jaguar 's share price could zoom to between eight and ten pounds twelve point six zero to fifteen dollars and eighty cents
There 's quite a bit of value left in the Jaguar shares here even though they have run up lately says Doug Johnson a fund manager for Seattle based Safeco Asset Management
At the moment he intends to keep the firm 's one hundred eighty thousand Jaguar shares
The risk is that Jaguar 's share price could slump if G. M. 's agreement with Jaguar effectively locks out its U. S. rival
Ford 's appetite to attack Jaguar could gradually wane over time particularly if Saab is a reasonably attractive proposition says John Lawson an auto analyst at London 's Nomura Research Institute
He thinks Saab Scania A. B. on Friday will announce the sale of fifty percent of its car division to Ford the companies have been discussing closer cooperation for months
I thought the probabilities of a bidding war happening were less he says
Of course that was before Ford 's latest move

The stock had hit a high of eighty one dollars a share early last week but collapsed to seventy three dollars and fifty cents in the Friday stock plunge
The company had been experiencing softening margins because of increased sales of software applications which have lower margins than do operating systems
But the company said that trend was offset in the first quarter by better economies of scale and efficiencies in manufacturing
As a result Microsoft 's cost of goods as a percentage of sales fell seventeen percent from the year ago quarter and thirteen percent from the previous period
The trend drove up the aftertax margin net income as a percentage of revenues to twenty one point one percent in the quarter compared with twenty point seven percent a year earlier
Microsoft officials said the strong results also reflected continuing high demand for its software applications and operating systems
That segment continues to post strong quarter to quarter gains while the low end or commodity segment of the industry is experiencing sluggish growth or even sales declines
Compared with its previous quarter the final period of its nineteen eighty nine fiscal year net rose nine percent and sales rose seven percent

Interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in sophistication and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities
Eventually viewers may grow bored with the technology and resent the cost

With the competitiveness of the television market these days everyone is looking for a way to get viewers more excited
One of the leaders behind the expanded use of nine hundred numbers is Call Interactive a joint venture of giants American Express Company and American Telephone & Telegraph Co

In recent months the technology has become more flexible and able to handle much more volume
Before callers of nine hundred numbers would just listen and not talk or they 'd vote yes or no by calling one of two numbers
People in the phone business call this technology nine hundred click
Now callers are led through complex menus of choices to retrieve information they want and the hardware can process ten thousand calls in ninety seconds

Mr. Parks of Call Interactive says T. V. executives are considering the use of nine hundred numbers for talk shows game shows news and opinion surveys
Experts are predicting a big influx of new shows in nineteen ninety when a service called automatic number information will become widely available
This service identifies each caller 's phone number and it can be used to generate instant mailing lists
Hard Copy the new syndicated tabloid show from Paramount Pictures will use its nine hundred number for additional purposes that include research says executive producer Mark B. von S. Monsky
For a piece on local heroes of World War Two we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal he says
That 'll save us time and get people involved
But Mr. Monsky sees much bigger changes ahead
These are just baby steps toward real interactive video which I believe will be the biggest thing yet to affect television he says
Although it would be costly to shoot multiple versions T. V. programmers could let audiences vote on different endings for a movie
Fox Broadcasting experimented with this concept last year when viewers of Married With Children voted on whether Al should say I love you to Peg on Valentine 's Day
Someday viewers may also choose different depths of news coverage
A menu by phone could let you decide I 'm interested in just the beginning of story Number one and I want story Number two in depth Mr. Monsky says
You 'll start to see shows where viewers program the program

Right away you notice the following things about a Philip Glass concert
It attracts people with funny hair or with no hair in front of me a girl with spiked locks sat beside a boy who had shaved his
Whoever constitute the local Left Bank come out in force dressed in black along with a smattering of yuppies who want to be on the cutting edge
People in Glass houses tend to look stoned
And if still conscious at the evening 's end you notice something else The audience at first entranced and hypnotized by the music releases its pent up feelings in collective gratitude
Currently in the middle of a four week twenty city tour as a solo pianist Mr. Glass has left behind his synthesizers equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone
He sits down at the piano and plays
And plays
Either one likes it or one does n't
The typical Glass audience which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers certainly does
The work though sounds like Muzak for spaceships
Philip Glass is the emperor and his music the new clothes of the avant garde
His success is easy to understand
Softly introducing and explaining his pieces Mr. Glass looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital
The piano compositions which have been labeled variously as minimalist Oriental repetitive cyclical monophonic and hypnotic are relentlessly tonal therefore unthreatening unvaryingly rhythmic therefore soporific and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic therefore both pretty and unconventional
It is music for people who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task
It is E. Z. listening for the now generation
Mr. Glass has inverted the famous modernist dictum less is more
His more is always less
Far from being minimalist the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of four quarters time octave intervals and ragtime or gospel chord progressions
But the music has its charm and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex
There is a recognizable musical style here but not a particular performance style
The music is not especially pianistic indeed it 's hard to imagine a bad performance of it
Nothing bravura no arpeggios no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer
We hear we may think inner voices but they all seem to be saying the same thing
With Planet News music meant to accompany readings of Allen Ginsberg 's Wichita Vortex Sutra Mr. Glass gets going
His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard
Seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a very slow improvisatory riff
The chords modulate but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys
Contrasts predictably accumulate First the music is loud then it becomes soft then you realize it becomes louder again
The Fourth Knee Play an interlude from Einstein on the Beach is like a toccata but it does n't seem to move much beyond its left hand ground in Three Blind Mice
When Mr. Glass decides to get really fancy he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand
He does this in at least three of his solo pieces
You might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment
Not only is the typical Glasswork open ended it is also often multiple in its context s
Mad Rush began its life as the accompaniment to the Dalai Lama 's first public address in the U. S. when Mr. Glass played it on the organ at New York 's Cathedral of Street John the Divine
Later it was performed on Radio Bremen in Germany and then Lucinda Childs took it for one of her dance pieces
The point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything
The evening ended with Mr. Glass 's Metamorphosis another multiple work
Parts one two and five come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris 's acclaimed film The Thin Blue Line and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name
When used as background in this way the music has an appropriate eeriness as when a two note phrase a descending minor third accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film
Served up as a solo however the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium
Admirers of Mr. Glass may agree with the critic Richard Kostelanetz 's sense that the nineteen seventy four Music in Twelve Parts is as encyclopedic and weighty as The Well Tempered Clavier
But while making the obvious point that both composers develop variations from themes this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. Glass 's music
Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern and what in retrospect even seems like concision in Mahler

Honeywell Incorporated said it hopes to complete shortly the first of two sales of shares in its Japanese joint venture Yamatake Honeywell for about two hundred eighty million dollars
The company would n't disclose the buyer of the initial sixteen percent stake
Proceeds of the sale expected to be completed next week would be used to repurchase as many as ten million shares of Honeywell stock the company said
Honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in Yamatake Honeywell but indicated it intends to hold at least twenty percent of the joint venture 's stock long term
A twenty percent stake would allow Honeywell to include Yamatake earnings in its results
Honeywell previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the Japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of dependence on weapons sales
Yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was pleased with our progress in that regard and hopes to provide additional details soon
Honeywell said its Defense and Marine Systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter resulting in lower operating profit for that business
The previous period 's results included a one hundred eight million dollars pretax charge related to unrecoverable contract costs and a twelve point three million dollars pretax gain on real estate sales
Sales for the latest quarter were flat at one point seven two billion dollars
Sales declined slightly to five point one seven billion dollars
Once again your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions
This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive but it is simply wrong
The Clean Water Act contains no legal standard of zero discharge
It requires that discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section three hundred one
Whatever may be the problems with this system it scarcely reflects zero risk or zero discharge
Perhaps Mr. Greve was confused by Congress 's meaningless statement of the national goal in section one hundred one which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges by nineteen eighty five no less
This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in nineteen seventy two and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute

National Geographic the sixth largest U. S. magazine is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy high toned pages that upscale advertisers love
So why did advertising pages plunge by almost ten percent and ad revenue by seven point two percent in the first half
To hear advertisers tell it the magazine just has n't kept up with the times
Despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the Third World it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women
Worse it lagged behind competitors in offering now standard gimmicks from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers
But now the magazine is attempting to fight back with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign
Advertisers do n't think of the magazine first says Joan McCraw who joined in April as national advertising director
What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance
People did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace and in many ways we were n't
The one hundred one year old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before
The magazine had its best year yet in nineteen eighty eight when it celebrated its centennial and racked up a seventeen percent gain in ad pages to two hundred eighty three
But this year when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died so too did some advertiser interest
The reason ad executives say is that the entire magazine business has been soft and National Geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market
Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices one hundred thirty thousand dollars for a four color page versus forty seven thousand dollars for the Smithsonian a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation
When ad dollars are tight the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all
Even though National Geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like Smithsonian the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency says Harry Glass New York media manager for Bozell Incorporated
But the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors
Time magazine for example has more than one hundred separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups
Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic 's tradition of lumping its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than spreading ads out among its articles as most magazines do
And National Geographic 's smaller than average size means extra production costs for advertisers
But Ms. McCraw says the magazine is fighting back
It now offers thirty regional editions it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles and it has been beefing up its sales force
And it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives marketing directors and media executives just that
The centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign into which the magazine will pour about five hundred thousand dollars mostly in the next few weeks
The campaign created by Omnicom Group 's D. D. B. Needham agency takes advantage of the eye catching photography that National Geographic is known for
In one ad a photo of the interior of the Sainte Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline The only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising
Another ad pictures a tree ant magnified eighty times with the headline For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions
Ms. McCraw says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in ten categories including corporate financial services consumer electronics insurance and food
Her goal to top three hundred ad pages in nineteen ninety up from about two hundred seventy four this year
Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain
The ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of National Geographic she says
We want it to be a nineties kind of image
W. C. R. S. Plans Ad Unit Sale
W. C. R. S. Group hopes to announce perhaps today an agreement to sell the majority of its ad unit to Paris based Eurocom a European ad executive said
W. C. R. S. has been in discussions with Eurocom for several months
However when negotiations bogged down recently W. C. R. S. 's chief executive Peter Scott met in Paris with another French firm Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit or B. D. D. P.
According to the executive B. D. D. P. 's involvement prompted renewed vigor in the W. C. R. S. Eurocom talks and the two agencies were hoping to hammer out details by today
Executives of the two agencies could n't be reached last night

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders
The C. F. T. C. said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites problems associated with the practice
Dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers
The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange
While not specifically mentioned in the F. B. I. charges dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations
Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders
Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders
The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand
The exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration
The C. F. T. C. may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions
The agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them
Wendy Gramm the agency 's chairman told the Senate Agriculture Committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by Thanksgiving
The study by the C. F. T. C. 's division of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said
Whether a trade is done on a dual or non dual basis the member said does n't seem to have much economic impact
Currently most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts which makes them brokers or for their own accounts as socalled locals
The tests indicate that dual and non dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel
Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize C. F. T. C. operations
The House 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of seven thousand contracts or more comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system
The Senate bill would force the C. F. T. C. to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual trading abuses
So far one test of restricting dual trading has worked well
The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard & Poor 's five hundred stock index futures pit in nineteen eighty seven
Under the rules traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers
Traders who stand on the pit 's top step where most customer orders are executed ca n't trade for themselves
A Merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit
It 's too soon to tell but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it he said
He said he would n't comment on the C. F. T. C. plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal
But at a meeting last week Tom Donovan the Board of Trade 's president told commodity lawyers Dual trading is definitely worth saving
It adds something to the market
Japanese Firms Push Posh Car Showrooms
JAPANESE luxury car makers are trying to set strict design standards for their dealerships
But some dealers are negotiating looser terms while others decline to deal at all
Nissan Motor Company 's Infiniti division likes to insist that every dealer construct and furnish a building in a Japanese style
Specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each showroom and a tile bridge spanning a stream that flows into the building from outside
Infiniti has it down to the ashtrays says Jay Ferron a partner at J. D. Power & Associates an auto research firm
Toyota Motor Corporation 's Lexus division also provides specifications
But only two thirds of Lexus dealers are constructing new buildings according to the Lexus specs
Some are even coming up with their own novel designs
In Louisville Kentucky for example David Peterson has built a Lexus dealership with the showroom on the second floor
Yet some dealers have turned down Infiniti or Lexus franchises because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements
Lee Seidman of Cleveland says Infiniti was a bear on interiors but at least let him retrofit an existing building without the stream
Mr. Seidman says he turned down a Lexus franchise in part because the building was gorgeous but very expensive
To head off arguments Infiniti offers dealers cash bonuses and low interest construction loans
Dictation Device 's Saga Plays Back a Lesson
PRODUCTS DON'T have to be first to be winners
That 's the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit
Dictaphone Corporation was caught off guard in nineteen seventy four when its main competitor Lanier Office Products of Japan introduced a microcassette dictation recorder half the size of standard cassette devices
Blocked by patent protection from following suit Dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again down to the length of a paperclip
By nineteen seventy nine designers and engineers at Dictaphone a Pitney Bowes subsidiary had produced a working model of a picocassette recorder
By nineteen eighty two however the patent status of the Lanier microcassette had changed permitting Dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system which it did
Marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pico project
But others said pico should proceed
Both were right
Dictaphone went ahead and introduced the pico in nineteen eighty five but it has n't sold well
To date says Emil Jachmann a Dictaphone vice president it has broken even or shown a small loss
Nevertheless the device has been successful in other ways
It helped Dictaphone attract better engineers and it provided new technology for other company products
The picocassette recorder also helped transform the company 's reputation from follower to leading edge innovator
It gave me great pride to see the inventor of the microcassette in Japan look at the pico and shake his head and say unbelievable says Mr. Jachmann
Dictaphone 's picocassette recorder is one of thirteen case studies in the TRIAD Design Project sponsored by the Design Management Institute of Boston and Harvard Business School
The studies are on exhibit at Harvard this month and will travel to Chicago 's Institute of Design and the University of California at Berkeley
A Rake 's Progress Means Branching Out
ONE DAY Carl Barrett of Mobile Alabama was raking some sycamore leaves but the rake kept riding up over the piles
The harder he tried to push them into large piles the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back
So Mr. Barrett then vice president of the Alabama Steamship Association took a steel toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up
His crude device worked The lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile while the higher harder teeth moved the top of the pile
Now incorporated into a polypropylene rake the four inch prongs or wonderbars also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves
One customer Donald Blaggs of Mobile says the Barrett Rake allowed him to do his lawn in two and a half hours two hours less than usual
But other rake makers have their doubts
Richard Mason president of Ames Company in Parkersburg W. Virginia says the Barrett rake makes sense but it would be tough to explain to consumers
John Stoner marketing director for True Temper Corporation a subsidiary of Black & Decker says people do n't want to move a leaf pile
They either pick it up he says or they start pulling from a fresh direction

The Pentagon is a haunted house
Living there for six years was really scary
The ghosts of the past are everywhere They are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget
Some can be bought off relatively cheaply
During the Korean War General Douglas MacArthur demanded and got in addition to his U. N. command in Korea his own naval command in Japan NavforJapan
Those obsolete operations cost less than two billion dollars a year and keep Mac 's ghost quiet
That 's about all it costs to appease Admiral Erich Raeder 's ghost
In nineteen forty one Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal so we created the Southern Command in Panama
The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder 's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like General Noriega
So far no one has
The ghost of the Soviet brigade discovered in Cuba back in the seventies costs just a few hundred million the price of the Caribbean Command in Key West that President Carter created in nineteen eighty
The brigade has n't been heard from since but we keep the staff around just in case
George Marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy
We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon statues busts relics and such
The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used to burn a lot of incense to him but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it
You see Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the Marines he wanted to make them part of the Army but Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal blocked him
Now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done
To keep him quiet we invent a new unified command every year or so run by the Army or the Air Force and put more of the Navy and Marines under it
Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all the ghost of the shah of Iran
When the shah died President Carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the Carter Doctrine
Mr. Carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab Iran
But that ghost would n't settle for words he wanted money and people lots
So Mr. Carter formed three new Army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in Tampa called the Rapid Deployment Force
But that ghost was n't fooled he knew the R. D. F. was neither rapid nor deployable nor a force even though it cost eight billion dollars or ten billion dollars a year
After Mr. Carter was defeated in nineteen eighty the shah 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after President Reagan and Cap Weinberger
I saw what he did to them firsthand
It made my shoelaces dance with terror
He bought four billion dollars in prepositioning ships and seven billion dollars in ammo and equipment to fill them and parked them at a new six billion dollars base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean
He dedicated all these new forces to the Persian Gulf
One night both Marshall 's ghost and the shah 's ghost together caught Cap and threw him to the ground
Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the R. D. F. in Tampa and renamed it Central Command
He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean
Marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers someday maybe they would get the whole Navy
They had fun moving the carriers around but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers
Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia twelve thousand miles away
We 'd get our asses kicked
Lucky for Cap Ike was easygoing and soon went away while the shah he kept coming back
So the U. S. found itself paying about two billion dollars in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean
We had great success in Somalia
But who 's counting
Still Berbera was the best we could get so we stay in bed with President Barrah
All these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway
Meanwhile Congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget
Predictably some Navy guys said Do we still need to keep all eighteen Army divisions on active duty and all those extra land based aircraft without bases and all those Army guys playing admiral in Tampa
Could n't we save twenty billion dollars or thirty billion dollars a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves
And why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by abolishing Central Command and putting responsibility for Gulf naval operations back where it belongs afloat with the task force commander in the Gulf
And where were all our handsomely paid Indian Ocean allies last year when our convoys were being attacked
Questions like that really stir up Marshall 's ghost
He appeared late one night in the bedroom of the new defense secretary Dick Cheney
Marshall came clanking in like Marley 's ghost dragging those chains of brigades and air wings and links with Arab despots
He would n't leave until Mr. Cheney promised to do whatever the Pentagon systems analysts told him
So next day Mr. Cheney went out and did just that He canceled the six hundred ship Navy and cut back one carrier and twenty frigates
Then he canceled production of the Navy 's most important carrier aircraft the F. fourteen and the A. six
On the other hand Mr. Cheney retained all those new land forces
Marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now but he 'll be back
What with Halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are crawling under their desks
They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships
Then the whole thing will start to collapse just as it did in the nineteen seventies and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning people 's hair white
Gives me the willies just thinking about it

The metal and marble lobby of CenTrust Bank 's headquarters is grander than your average savings and loan
For one thing there is an old master on the wall Samuel Anointing David a big baroque canvas painted by Mattia Preti a seventeenth century Neapolitan
At the moment however the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed CenTrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive David L. Paul
In an international buying spree that began barely two years ago Mr. Paul amassed a collection of about thirty pre eighteenth century works including the Preti at a total cost of twenty eight million dollars
By midnight October sixth all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off under orders from Florida 's comptroller whose office regulates the state 's S&Ls
CenTrust did n't meet the deadline
The rub is that the twenty eight million dollars was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist
Mr. Paul had no right to buy art for the S. & L. in the first place it is n't on the comptroller 's permissible list without seeking a special dispensation which he did not do
Besides that some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of CenTrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on La Gorce Isle off Miami Beach
Last spring the comptroller 's office called a halt to Mr. Paul 's fling giving him six months to sell the paintings
The acquisitions officials said in a letter to Mr. Paul were unsafe unsound and unauthorized
So far Mr. Paul has unloaded but three of his masterpieces he wo n't say to whom
The comptroller 's office says it is monitoring the situation
Though the agency could remove Mr. Paul it has no current intention to do that
It 's not like selling Chevrolets Mr. Paul says as he takes a drag on a goldbanded Street Moritz cigarette
The last six months has established the quality of the collection
There 's no fire sale here
Despite Mr. Paul 's characteristic hauteur the fifty year old chain smoking dynamo is finding that getting CenTrust Florida 's largest thrift institution out of its riskiest investments is much tougher than getting into them had been
Paintings are just part of the picture
Although Mr. Paul has pared a one point three five billion dollars junk bond portfolio to less than nine hundred million dollars since April the high yield debt market has plummeted
Divesting itself of what is left as is required of all thrift institutions by July nineteen ninety four under the new federal S. & L. bailout law may well prove difficult
And CenTrust has other problems
Late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock a move that suggests deep concern about an institution
Mr. Paul has a plan to bring in one hundred fifty million dollars by selling off sixty three of CenTrust 's seventy one branches but it has yet to be approved by regulators
It is Mr. Paul 's art venture however that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators not to mention galleries throughout the world
Embittered shareholders some of whom are suing say the chairman and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national S. & L. crisis
CenTrust shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of fifteen point one two five dollars in nineteen eighty six to close yesterday at two point eight seven five dollars
Gallery directors meanwhile say Mr. Paul and others of his ilk have left an indelible mark on the art world and not for the better
Collectors do n't say It 's a van Gogh anymore laments Harry Brooks the president of Wildenstein & Company a New York gallery
They say Johnny Payson got fifty three million dollars for his so certainly ten million dollars is n't too much for mine
The great collectors we depended on such as Paul Mellon or Norton Simon have stopped buying and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting
Mr. Payson an art dealer and collector sold Vincent van Gogh 's Irises at a Sotheby 's auction in November nineteen eighty seven to Australian businessman Alan Bond
Trouble is Mr. Bond has yet to pay up and until he does Sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key
When Mr. Paul moved in on the art market he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by CenTrust
He established his reputation as a freespender in January last year at Sotheby 's auction of the Linda and Gerald Guterman collection in New York
There on one of his first shopping trips Mr. Paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices
He paid two point two million dollars for instance for a still life by Jan Jansz. den Uyl that was expected to fetch perhaps seven hundred thousand dollars
The price paid was a record for the artist
Some sixty four percent of items offered at the Guterman auction were sold at an average price of three hundred forty three thousand three hundred thirty three dollars
The rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids
Afterward Mr. Paul is said by Mr. Guterman to have phoned Mr. Guterman the New York developer selling the collection and gloated
He says he stole them recalls Mr. Guterman
And he tells me If you want to see your paintings you 'll have to come to my house in Florida
Mr. Paul denies phoning and gloating
It 's just not true he says
Mr. Paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting with the help of George Wachter a Sotheby 's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the Guterman items
Mr. Wachter who became his principal adviser searched galleries in London Paris and Monaco
And according to one dealer Mr. Wachter had a penchant for introducing Mr. Paul with the phrase He can buy anything
Nicholas Hall the president of the Colnaghi U. S. A. Limited gallery in New York sold Mr. Paul Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo
Mr. Hall says Mr. Paul was known to spend a lot of money
People were interested in seeing him but it was recognized that the route was through Sotheby 's and particularly George Wachter
Mr. Paul thus developed a close symbiotic relationship with Sotheby 's
Mr. Paul was eager to assemble a collection for the headquarters CenTrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year
European dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters which Sotheby 's North America had lately been touting in this country
For several months there was optimism all around
Last October Mr. Paul paid out twelve million dollars of CenTrust 's cash plus a one point two million dollars commission for Portrait of a Man as Mars
The painting attributed to Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens was purchased privately through Sotheby 's not at auction
In March nineteen eighty nine just fifteen months into his campaign Mr. Paul was named by Art & Antiques magazine as one of the top one hundred individual collectors in the U. S.
An unknown quantity to most of the art world Paul is no stranger to lavish spending the magazine said noting that he does n't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat
He recently bid thirty thousand dollars at a Paris charity auction for a dinner cooked by six of the world 's great chefs but the final party cost closer to one hundred thousand dollars
Mr. Paul says it was n't that high
The art collection might have come to rival the Medicis ' had the Florida comptroller 's office not got wind of Mr. Paul 's aesthetic adventure
The state gave CenTrust thirty days to sell the Rubens
The comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands ordering that the book value of the collection be reduced to zero
In other words Get rid of all the pictures
The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to Mr. Paul Govern yourself accordingly
The state agency was particularly vexed to learn that the Rubens and a half dozen other paintings listed among the bank 's furniture and fixtures were actually hanging in the chairman 's house
Mr. Paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby 's
He explains that he was merely storing the paintings at home with some display because of the special dehumidified environment required for their safekeeping until CenTrust 's new building was ready for them
Still the incident was embarrassing
It came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that Mr. Paul has benefited handsomely from his association with CenTrust
For instance he got a three million dollars loan from the S. & L. negotiated at a below market rate
He owns forty three percent of CenTrust 's shares
Adding to Mr. Paul 's problems dealers some with vested interests insist that he relying rather too heavily on Sotheby 's advice paid much too much for several pieces in the CenTrust collection
The twelve million dollars lavished on the Rubens for example was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value given a dispute among scholars about its provenance
David Tunick the president of David Tunick Incorporated a New York gallery says scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens
It may have been painted instead by a Rubens associate
The feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event Mr. Tunick says
It sounds like with the Rubens he got absolutely taken to the cleaners
It 's not beyond credibility the Rubens will someday be worth twelve million dollars but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen
Still predicting is tricky
I 'm forever dumbfounded by what I see making these high prices
Jonathan H. Kress the son of the painting 's former owner Mrs. Rush Kress dismisses the price talk as sour grapes
Dealers contemptuous of the purchase price he says were themselves interested in buying the Rubens but lost out
Mr. Paul for his part defends the Rubens price saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself
Most of them were n't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly he says
Art prices are skyrocketing but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales
Salomon Brothers Incorporated the investment banking firm in its annual tally of investment returns reported that old masters appreciated fifty one percent in the year ended June first the greatest return of any of thirteen assets it tracked
Impressionist and modern paintings not tracked by Salomon are ranked even higher at seventy four percent by Sotheby 's
Salomon moreover gets its data on art appreciation from Sotheby 's whose prices go up with clients like Mr. Paul in its thrall
The percentages omit from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction
Art indexes track winners not losers
But art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale
Also at any of Sotheby 's auctions of old masters roughly one third to one fifth of what is offered does n't sell at any price
It 's not that there are n't any bids but the bids do n't meet the minimum reserve prices set by the sellers
In January the Preti painting that now hangs at CenTrust was expected to bring no more than seven hundred thousand dollars at auction until Mr. Paul came along with his one point one five million dollars
Mr. Hall of the Colnaghi gallery says one point one five million dollars would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a Preti four years ago
But from his vantage point it is n't that Mr. Paul a customer of his too overpaid for the work a gargantuan painting by an artist who is not a household word
The painting is ten feet wide seven feet high
Rather It just shows things have changed
Mr. Paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn
They went up fifty one percent last year and they 'll do it again this year he declares
They were a sleeper
Everybody was out buying Monets
Sotheby 's vice president Diana Levitt says the auction house has been assisting Mr. Paul in selling the paintings
And while Sotheby 's chief rivals in the art world private art dealers wo n't be happy to hear it she adds a number of the artworks have already been sold and at a substantial profit
Mr. Paul claims to have sold three paintings at more than a ten percent profit
That is n't fifty one percent and the claim is n't documented
He furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on Sotheby 's or Mr. Wachter
Mr. Paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid impulsively
After all he had the counsel of curators from the most reputable museums in the world
He says he expects to sell the collection including the controversial Rubens carefully and prudently just as it was put together
But in art world parlance Mr. Paul 's holdings are burnt
That is he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works
After a few years you can argue there has been natural appreciation says Susan Theran the publisher of Leonard 's Annual Price Index of Art Auctions
But quick turnover in artwork is like pawning your jewelry you end up with fifty percent
People hold out and try to get a bargain
Sotheby 's defends itself and Mr. Paul in the matter
Mr. Wachter says Mr. Paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment
On occasion he paid a high price Mr. Wachter concedes but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors
Sotheby 's she says is wearing both hats
I ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest says Sotheby 's Ms. Levitt
Estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be
Frequently clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding she adds so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be
Mr. Paul in selling off his paintings is seeking at least a fifteen percent return on the bank 's investment so as to prove that the venture was sound
Mr. Paul says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as Japan and Italy have examined the collection
Because of the pressure on CenTrust to sell dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at bargain basement prices
But so far Mr. Paul and his advisers are holding fast
One dealer Martin Zimet of French & Company in New York says he would have loved to buy a Jan Davids de Heem painting from the bank
I tried to steal the picture to buy it attractively and Sotheby 's would n't do it
They were protecting his interests
Meanwhile Mr. Paul and CenTrust executives are getting squeamish about opulence
Mr. Paul has been characterized as the Great Gatsby or something complains Karen E. Brinkman an executive vice president of CenTrust
The media she says have distorted his personal life
Mr. Paul nods in agreement
I do n't think I have a life style that is frankly so flamboyant he says
But at just that moment he is interrupted in his office by a servant in tuxedo who pours coffee from silver into a cup of china and dabs the brim with linen
Mr. Paul says yes the ceiling in his executive suite is gold leaf inlay
The offices are done in hardwood and oriental rugs leatherbound books and of course a twelve million dollars Rubens
But he implores that the splendor be played down
Do n't say it 's a gold ceiling
Just say the offices are tastefully appointed he says
Otherwise the regulators will take it for decadence and nowadays everything 's got to be pristine
Figures do n't include taxes or transaction costs
Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates

Otherwise actual profit is compared with the three hundred day estimate
During its centennial year The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history
CREATIVE ACCOUNTING mostly by conglomerates forced CPAs to change their way of setting standards to be followed by corporations reporting financial results standards that had become all too flexible
The new Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB was created in nineteen seventy two to replace the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
All of the former board 's members were CPAs provoking conflict of interest criticism because they were writing rules while handling clients ' books at the same time
The new board 's seven member structure kept four CPAs but the others were from industry and academia
Francis M. Wheat a former Securities and Exchange Commission member headed the panel that had studied the issues for a year and proposed the FASB on March thirtieth nineteen seventy two
The former board had produced twenty one opinions and one thousand critics in its twelve year life its chairman had conceded
The climate was right for the new FASB
In the late nineteen sixties some CPAs failed to correct such abuses as clients picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices
And in November nineteen seventy Congress had passed a special act to overrule one board rule
Also James Needham an S. E. C. commissioner in April nineteen seventy two had warned that the industry might face a federal agency writing accounting rules if they rejected the FASB idea
Keepers of the books dubbed figure filberts loathed the threat
The FASB had its initial meeting on March twenty eighth nineteen seventy three
On December thirteenth nineteen seventy three it issued its first rule it required companies to disclose foreign currency translations in U. S. dollars
The FASB since then has issued one hundred two rules and some still rile industry
Since late nineteen eighty seven for example it has put off a rule dealing with deferred income taxes because of the continuing controversy over the issue

Reynolds is the third big aluminum company since Friday to report disappointing earnings
The Number one domestic aluminum producer Aluminum Company of America Friday said its earnings fell three point two percent to two hundred nineteen million dollars or two dollars and forty six cents a share
And Alcan Aluminium Limited yesterday reported net income slid thirty percent to one hundred eighty million dollars or seventy seven cents a share from two hundred fifty eight million dollars or one dollar and seven cents a share
Analysts on average had been expecting about two dollars and seventy cents for Alcoa and one dollar for Alcan
The nation 's Number two aluminum company said earnings were hurt by lower prices for certain fabricated aluminum products which typically follow price fluctuations of primary ingots
The base metal price has dropped thirty point three percent from a year earlier to seventy eight cents a pound
Much of the price decline has been blamed on a slowing economy and the third quarter is typically the industry 's slowest period
But William O. Bourke chairman and chief executive officer said the ingot price appears to have bottomed out
He said shipments are continuing at a healthy pace and the company has no excess inventory
Aluminum shipments of three hundred twenty nine thousand six hundred metric tons were nearly equal to the year earlier period the company said
Nevertheless the company said that in the latest quarter there were increased material and labor costs including a new employee profit sharing plan
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Reynolds closed at fifty five point three seven five dollars up one dollar and twenty five cents
No strikeout but certainly no home run
That 's how the stock picking game is shaping up for the months ahead according to money managers and a few brokers
Yesterday 's eighty eight point recovery from Friday 's megadrop in the Dow Jones industrials had many brokerage houses proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again
But quite a few money managers are n't buying it
Weakening corporate earnings they say are no prescription for a bull market
The stock market ai n't going to do much of anything for a while says John Neff of Wellington Management who runs the eight point three billion dollars Windsor Fund
He suspects that Friday 's market decline may have a second leg perhaps a ten percent to fifteen percent drop later on
Mr. Neff says the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces namely earnings growth and the L. B. O. sweepstakes buy out fever that induced investors to bid up whole groups of stocks such as media and airlines
After sitting with twenty percent of his fund in cash before Friday 's sell off Mr. Neff says he bought a narrow list of stocks yesterday
With flat corporate profits on the horizon for nineteen ninety money managers say price earnings multiples that look cheap today might go on being cheap for a long time
This is not a grossly overvalued market but it 's not cheap either says George Collins president of the mutual fund company T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore
Bulls say the market is an incredible bargain priced at only about twelve times estimated nineteen eighty nine earnings for stocks in the Standard & Poor 's five hundred index
Before the nineteen eighty seven crash the P. E. was more than twenty
The common view says Abby Cohen strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert is that there will be mild economic growth modest profit expansion and things are going to be hunky dory
Our view is that we may see a profit decline
Some think investors should sell into rallies
The market is going to wind down says Gerald W. Perritt a Chicago money manager
Things are a little less overpriced after Friday 's jolt in the market
He expects stocks to decline an additional five percent to thirty percent with the Dow perhaps bottoming out between two thousand oh and two thousand one hundred between now and June
He found eighty five still overvalued and fifteen fairly valued
Nicholas Parks a New York money manager expects the market to decline about fifteen percent
I 've been two thirds in cash since July and I continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate he says
Companies that piled on debt in leveraged buy outs during the past two years will continue to surface as business problems
Generalizations about value are n't useful says New York money manager John LeFrere of Delta Capital Management
For instance he says International Business Machines and Unisys might look cheap but investors might continue to do better with stocks like Walt Disney Procter & Gamble and Coca Cola strong performers in recent years
Money manager Robert Ross head of Duncan Ross Associates Limited in Vancouver British Columbia says stocks would have to fall fifteen percent to twenty percent before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives
Fredric Russell a money manager in Tulsa Oklahoma says Friday 's cave in is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many investors than Wall Street would want to admit
There are still bulls out there
I still think we will have a three thousand Dow whether it 's six months or twelve months from now I do n't know says David Dreman managing partner of Dreman Value Management in New York
We 're doing a little buying in some stocks that have really been smashed down
Many brokerage house officials also are optimistic
Yesterday Goldman Sachs Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks
Dean Witter now recommends eighty five percent Goldman sixty five percent and Merrill Lynch fifty percent
Some investors say Friday 's sell off was a good thing because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation
It was a healthy cleansing says Michael Holland who runs Salomon Brothers Asset Management in New York
From here out these investors see a return to old fashioned investing based on a company 's ability to show profit growth
The fundamentals are pretty strong Mr. Dreman says
I do n't see this as a bear market at all
It 's a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the L. B. O. market
Friday 's big fall was just a blunder by the stock market says John Connolly chief strategist for Dean Witter
It was an overreaction to an event the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of U. A. L. that does n't mean that much to lots of stocks
Many investors have nagging worries however
Newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans
That hurts investors ' confidence in the economy and stocks
Not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead
Disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters says Mary Farrell a market strategist at PaineWebber
She thinks the market could drop about ten percent in the next few months then recover and go higher
Companies with steady earnings growth could do well she says while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than ten percent
The turmoil on Wall Street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy outs of their specialty and department store chains investment bankers and retailers said
Managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies
Hooker is based in Sydney Australia
The combination of so many chains available for sale the recent failures of such retailing L. B. O. 's as Miller & Rhoads Incorporated and declining investor confidence will drive down prices retailing observers said
The pricing will become more realistic which should help management said Bruce Rosenthal a New York investment banker with Nathan S. Jonas & Co
Investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed LBOs but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense either
Earlier this year bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales Mr. Rosenthal added
Those days are over now he believes
Competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue added Mr. Rosenthal
But when prices were crazy it was even harder to do an L. B. O.
Bankers believed in the greater fool theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more
This is no longer true today
At Saks Fifth Avenue Paul Leblang senior vice president marketing agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed L. B. O.
Having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage said Mr. Leblang
It would also help us in our search for equity partners
To make an L. B. O. work now we are going to need more than just junk bonds
None believe the proposed management LBOs will be easy to complete especially at B. Altman & Company which is under Chapter eleven bankruptcy protection
Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy but potential junk bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater management equity participation
Further many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments
It 's called bad money driving out good money said one retailing observer
Institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned
However the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt
In addition the fall selling season has generally been a good one especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues
What 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings not liquidation values said Joseph E. Brooks chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Incorporated a specialty chain
Retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies
Prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week which will help management said Gilbert Harrison chairman of Financo Incorporated an investment banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions
But the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved
Potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past
Sony Corporation won a pretrial order blocking U. S. sales of Justin Products Incorporated 's My Own line of portable audio players for children
Judge John E. Sprizzo issued the order in Manhattan federal court where Sony has accused the tiny company of illegally knocking off the My First Sony line
The judge held that the combination of colors used for the Sony products is distinctive and subject to protection under New York state law rather than federal law
The legal fight was the subject of a Wall Street Journal story yesterday
Justin 's attorney Charles E. Baxley said Justin would ask an appeals court to set aside the order temporarily pending an expedited appeal
He also repeated Justin 's denial of Sony 's charges
Their likelihood of reversing us is very slim said Lewis H. Eslinger Sony 's attorney who said he doubts Justin will go ahead with a trial

A federal appeals court struck down a natural gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of one billion dollars in costs from controversial take or pay contracts
The court in a three zero ruling threw out a deadline set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use
A majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled at steep discounts
But pipeline companies estimate they still face two point four billion dollars in liabilities from unresolved disputes including one billion dollars they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to customers
According to industry lawyers the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost sharing mechanism
The court left open whether F. E. R. C. could reimpose a new deadline later
The court ordered F. E. R. C. to justify within sixty days not only its cost sharing deadline but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural gas transportation
The court also questioned a crediting mechanism that could be used to resolve take or pay liabilities
The complex regulation known in the industry as Order five hundred has been hotly contested by all sides including natural gas producers pipelines local distribution companies and consumers
The court 's decision would allow F. E. R. C. to change some of its provisions but ensures it will be reviewed again quickly by the court

Angel Gurria Mexico 's top debt negotiator said the country 's creditor banks are responding positively to Mexico 's debt reduction package
Mr. Gurria 's optimism contrasts with some bankers ' views that the deal may require a lot of arm twisting by the U. S. Treasury in order to succeed

Korean car exports have slid about forty percent so far this year but auto makers here are n't panicking
They are enjoying domestic sales that are more than making up for lost overseas sales
South Korean consumers are expected to buy almost five hundred thousand passenger cars this year up sixty percent from nineteen eighty eight
In fact some auto executives suggest that slackened demand for their cars in the U. S. and Canada is a blessing otherwise they would n't be able to keep up with demand in the more profitable local market
We are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus says Hong Tu Pyo managing director of domestic marketing for Hyundai Motor Co
As it is waiting lists of a month are n't unusual for popular models
Demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers Hyundai Kia Motors Corporation Daewoo Motor Company and even upstart SsangYong Motor Company plan to build more factories
Industry analysts predict that by nineteen ninety five South Korea will be building three million cars a year about half of that for export
It 's an optimistic move in a industry already facing world wide overcapacity
But South Korean auto makers are confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in Korea will stay strong
Currently only one in thirty eight South Koreans owns a car up from one in two hundred a decade ago
In the year two thousand oh it will be one car per family
At that point domestic sales will slow down says Kim Yoon Kwon director of marketing for Daewoo Motor
The reason for the tremendous demand is simple South Koreans suddenly have a lot more money
We never thought we 'd own a car says Kwang Ok Kyong who just bought a Daewoo LeMans on a five year loan
She and her husband started a small printing business and need the car for work as well as for weekend jaunts
Pay raises of sixty percent over the past three years have given many South Koreans the money to enjoy the things they were supplying the rest of the world
The success of newcomer SsangYong Motor shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity
A part of the construction oriented conglomerate SsangYong Group it took over the dying Dong A. Motor Company in nineteen eighty six
SsangYong began making variations of the Jeep like Korando vehicle
Dong A. had had a technology agreement with Jeep maker American Motors Corporation now a part of Chrysler Corporation
The most popular style is the stretched Family which resembles a Ford Bronco or Chevy Blazer
The four wheel drive vehicles start at fifteen thousand dollars a Family can cost over twenty five thousand dollars
SsangYong which has only about three percent of the domestic market will sell about eighteen thousand of its models this year twice as many as last year
It sees sales rising forty five percent to twenty six thousand units next year
The company plans to expand plant capacity fifty percent by nineteen ninety one
By then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the Volvo two hundred forty and selling for about twenty thousand dollars
Hyundai and Daewoo seem unconcerned about the SsangYong threat but Kia the scrappy No.3 auto maker is selling four wheel drive vehicles through its Asia unit
It plans to sell one thousand seven hundred units in nineteen eighty nine
Kia the only Korean car maker that has seen its overseas sales grow in nineteen eighty nine aims at Korea 's common man
Its advantage has been the peppy little Pride sold as the Ford Festiva in the U. S.
At three point eight million won or five thousand seven hundred dollars the econobox is the lowest priced car in South Korea
Along with two larger models the company claims eighteen percent of the domestic market
Ford Motor Company and Japan 's Mazda Motor Corporation have equity interests in Kia
Kia is the most aggressive of the Korean Big Three in offering financing
Loans for as long as five years make the cars very accessible with monthly payments as low as eighty thousand won or one hundred twenty dollars
Daewoo Motor a fifty fifty joint venture with General Motors Corporation and the Daewoo Group conglomerate is the only auto maker that appears to be hurting
Shipments of its Lemans to G. M. 's Pontiac division are off about sixty five percent from a year ago versus a forty four percent decline for Hyundai and an eighteen percent increase for Kia
Moreover Daewoo 's domestic sales have grown half as fast as sales of its rivals
The big problem for Daewoo which holds about twenty one percent of the market is the long series of labor disruptions it suffered this year
But Daewoo is expanding too
In fact a sister company Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery plans to build two hundred forty thousand minicars by the mid nineteen nineties
Hyundai the Korean market leader with a fifty eight percent share also plans to jump into minicars at the same time
It has a similar project for two hundred thousand cars a year
Kia is reportedly also considering such a plan
Even giant Samsung Group is rumored in the Korean press to be considering getting into the auto making business a company spokesman had no comment

Many skittish mutual fund investors picked up the phone yesterday but decided not to cash in their chips after all
As the stock market bounced back withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere trickle compared with Black Monday when investors dumped two point three billion dollars or about two percent of stock fund assets
Fidelity Investments the nation 's largest fund company said phone volume was more than double its typical level but still half that of October nineteenth nineteen eighty seven
Net outflows from Fidelity 's stock funds stood at less than three hundred million dollars or below fifteen percent of the two billion dollars cash position of the firm 's stock portfolios
Much of the money was switched into the firm 's money market funds
Outflows since the close of trading Friday remain below one third their level of two years ago Fidelity said
Other mutual fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests
And some investors at Fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day
Two years ago there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone said Kathryn McGrath head of the investment management division of the Securities and Exchange Commission
This time We do n't have that at all
Of course the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunges again
And any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash as some did during Black Monday
But funds generally are better prepared this time around
As a group their cash position of ten point two percent of assets in August the latest figure available is fourteen percent higher than two years earlier
Many fund managers have boosted their cash levels in recent weeks
The biggest flurry of investor activity came early in the day
Vanguard Group Incorporated saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone lines opened at eight thirty a.m
In the first hour the real nervous folks came along a spokesman said
But the horrendous pace of call volume in the first half hour slowed considerably
At Scudder Stevens & Clark Incorporated phone calls came in at forty percent more than the normal pace through early afternoon
Most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at eight a.m
As stocks rose in fact some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders
Many funds allow investors to void orders before the close of trading
At Scudder and at the smaller Ivy funds group in Hingham Massachusetts for instance some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds but later called back to reverse the switches
Because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close in this case at four p. m. these shareholders effectively stayed put
At Fidelity 's office in downtown Boston Gerald Sherman walked in shortly after seven thirty a. m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund
But by three fifteen p. m. with the market comfortably ahead for the day Mr. Sherman was preparing to undo his switch
It 's a nice feeling to know that things stabilized said Mr. Sherman the fifty one year old co owner of a discount department store
But some investors continued to switch out of high risk high yield junk funds despite yesterday 's rebound from that market 's recent price declines
Shareholders have been steadily bailing out of several big junk funds the past several weeks as the two hundred billion dollars market was jolted by a cash crunch at Campeau Corporation and steadily declining prices
Much of the money has been switched into money market funds fund executives say
Instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions however some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests
This avoids knocking down prices further
The one point one billion dollars T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund was among the funds that borrowed during the Campeau crisis says George J. Collins president of T. Rowe Price Associates Incorporated
That way Mr. Collins says We did n't have to sell securities in a sloppy market
When the market stabilized he added the firm sold the bonds and quickly paid the loans back

SOFT CONTACT LENSES WON federal blessing on March eighteenth nineteen seventy one and quickly became eye openers for their makers
The Food and Drug Administration that day said Bausch & Lomb could start selling them in the U. S.
The cornflake size product was more comfortable and less prone to falling out than hard contact lenses which had been around since nineteen thirty nine
Bausch & Lomb sold the softies under a sublicense from National Patent Development which had gained the rights from the Czechoslovakia Academy of Sciences
Otto Wichterle a Czech invented them in nineteen sixty two
The plastic lens wraps itself over the cornea absorbing eye moisture while permitting oxygen to pass through
But the new lens became the eye of a storm
In September nineteen seventy one California officials seized bootlegged lenses made by unlicensed companies after some showed traces of bacteria
In October doctors were debating the product 's safety some claiming it caused infections
And there were Senate hearings on the questions in July nineteen seventy two
The product overcame the bad publicity and kept evolving
The early soft lenses which cost three hundred dollars a set were expected to last for a year
In nineteen eighty three extended wear versions designed to be worn for thirty days at a time wree offered
Eighteen months ago a disposable seven day model bowed a year 's supply costs about five hundred dollars
Last month the F. D. A. and Contact Lens Institute cautioned users that serious eye infections could result from wearing lenses more than seven days at a stretch
Today twenty million of the twenty five million Americans using contact lenses are using the soft type
Including the accesory eye care products contacts account for two billion dollars in annual retail sales
Although Bausch remains the leader among the six majors Johnson & Johnson with its new disposables is coming on fast
The roller coaster stock market is making life tougher for small companies trying to raise money
In the wake of Friday 's plunge and yesterday 's rebound some companies are already postponing deals and others wish they could
As in other jittery times many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors shun risky deals seeking safety in bigger companies
Even if stock prices fully recover from Friday 's sharp decline the unsettled conditions will frighten many investors
The implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically says Henry Linsert Junior chairman of Martek Corporation a four year old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock
The more variables that indicate risk the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain
Earlier this month Staples Incorporated a Newton Massachusetts office supplies discounter said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public
At the time its shares were selling above their initial offering price of nineteen dollars and bankers believed Staples would sell new stock without a hitch
But with the company 's shares standing at fifteen dollars yesterday a new offering seems unlikely company officials say
Business however continues to be robust and the stock market has n't affected the concern 's expansion plans says Todd Krasnow a senior executive
Other companies figure they ca n't avoid the market
We have capital requirements says Mr. Linsert so we have to go ahead with a planned one point five billion dollars private placement
Unless the market goes right back up he says it may take us six to nine months to find the money instead of three
And the Columbia Maryland company may have to settle for a lower price he adds
Life is particularly nerve racking for companies that had planned to go public this week
Hand holding is becoming an investment banking job requirement
Robertson Stephens & Company a San Francisco investment banking concern has a client that looked forward to making its initial public offering yesterday
Officers of the company a health care concern were very discouraged on Friday and felt they should n't go public we felt they should says Sanford Robertson partner in the banking concern
As the market dropped Friday Robertson Stephens slashed the value of the offering by seven percent
Yesterday when similar securities rebounded it bumped the valuation up again
As of late yesterday the I. P. O. was still on
For many the situation is especially discouraging because the market for IPOs was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness
We were just beginning to look at the increase in IPOs seeing the light at the end of the tunnel says Frank Kline Junior partner in Lambda Funds a Beverly Hills California venture capital concern
But the tunnel 's just gotten longer
Companies planning to go public are definitely taking a second look says Allen Hadhazy senior analyst at the Institute for Econometric Research Fort Lauderdale Florida which publishes the New Issues newsletter on IPOs
He calculates that the recent market slide translated into a five percent to seven percent reduction in I. P. O. proceeds to companies
Many companies are hesitating
Exabyte Corporation had been planning to sell ten percent of its stock this week in an I. P. O. that would raise up to twenty eight point five million dollars
But now Peter Behrendt president says We 're making decisions on a day to day basis
Debt free and profitable the Boulder Colorado computer products concern could borrow funds if it decides against an I. P. O. now he says
KnowledgeWare Incorporated an Atlanta computer software concern says it is still planning to go ahead with its I. P. O. this week or next unless conditions change
It 's a wait and see situation right now says Terry McGowan president
Delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies
Sierra Tucson Companies a Tucson Arizona operator of addiction treatment centers has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an I. P. O. scheduled for next week
William O'Donnell president says he still thinks the I. P. O. will succeed
If it does n't he says the company would have to change its expansion timetable
But the market turmoil could be partially beneficial for some small businesses
In a sagging market the Federal Reserve System might flood the market with funds and that should bring interest rates down says Leonard T. Anctil vice president of the Bank of New England Boston
James G. Zafris president of Danvers Savings Bank Danvers Massachusetts says the market turmoil is an absolute non event for small business
For small companies he says interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges
Mr. Zafris thinks rates are heading down helping small companies
Peter Drake biotechnology analyst for Vector Securities International Chicago thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations
Partly because the nineteen eighty seven market crash made it harder for them to find financing many high technology concerns have made such alliances recently
Some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds
Alan Wells president of Bollinger Wells Lett & Company a New York merger specialist thinks panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy out and giant takeover deals
Instead they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies he says
And William E. Wetzel Junior a University of New Hampshire management professor and director of Venture Capital Network Incorporated says the market 's gyrations will underline the investors ' lack of control in big stock investments
This will add to the appeal of small business he says where investors often have a degree of influence
Bay Financial Corporation hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy court reorganization if it ca n't renegotiate its borrowings
Bay said a substantial part of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower than expected prices for sales made
The company said its real estate portfolio is highly leveraged while about two thirds of its investments are n't income producing
Thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments
According to its latest annual report about a quarter of the company 's holdings are in Massachusetts in the midst of a real estate slump
The company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended June thirtieth of thirty six point two million dollars or nine dollars and thirty three cents a share on revenue of thirteen point one million dollars
A year earlier the company had a loss of ten point eight million dollars or three dollars and four cents a share on revenue of ten point eight million dollars
For the year it had a net loss of sixty two million dollars or fifteen dollars and ninety seven cents a share on revenue of forty four point three million dollars
In the previous year it had a loss of twenty two point five million dollars or six dollars and fifty two cents a share on revenue of forty one point one million dollars
Although it is having serious cash flow problems Bay said the fair market value of its holdings minus debt was equal to six dollars and two cents a share at June thirtieth based on a recent appraisal
Book value per share which is based on investments at cost was a negative six dollars and sixty nine cents a share
A year earlier fair market value per share was twenty six dollars and two cents and book value was nine dollars and forty three cents a share

T. R. W. Incorporated reported a twelve percent decline in third quarter net income but the company said that excluding unusual gains in both quarters operating profit rose sixteen percent
The electronics automotive and aerospace concern said third quarter net was sixty million dollars or ninety eight cents a share down from sixty eight million dollars or one dollar and eleven cents a share a year earlier
Share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis by company tradition
The latest quarter included a gain of eleven cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs
Sales for the quarter rose eight point three percent to one point seven nine billion dollars from one point six five billion dollars with all three major product groups reporting gains
Automotive sales jumped sixteen percent to seven hundred ninety one million dollars mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems T. R. W. said
The group had an operating profit of sixty five million dollars against a loss of thirteen million dollars a year earlier
However excluding the year earlier charge for recall of steering gear operating profit in the latest quarter declined fourteen percent reflecting higher start up and product development expenses in passenger restraint systems
Materials and production costs also rose T. R. W. said
The information systems segment had a forty four percent jump sales to one hundred ninety six million dollars
An acquisition accounted for half the sales rise T. R. W. said
Operating profit rose threefold to eighteen million dollars from six million dollars
Sales rose two point nine percent to five point four two billion dollars from five point two seven billion dollars
a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic not unheroic though sadly self deceived English butler in his sixties proceeds as if the realistic English novel of manners like Britannia herself still ruled the waves
In fact Kazuo Ishiguro 's The Remains of the Day Knopf two hundred forty five pages eighteen dollars and ninety five cents is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them
As the narrator Stevens the solitary butler of Darlington Hall mulls over such hallowed terms as greatness dignity service and loyalty we see how pious cant subverts the soul
Stevens 's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms like his beloved master 's destroys all it was designed to preserve
Such armor crushes the soldier
The mask cuts to the quick
It 's nineteen fifty six the year the Suez crisis marked the final end of Empire
We call this land of ours Great Britain and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice
Yet I would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective
It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart
What is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty its sense of restraint
It is as though the land knows of its own beauty of its own greatness and feels no need to shout it
In comparison the sorts of sights offered in such places as Africa and America though undoubtedly very exciting would I am sure strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness
An effusive landscape
An ill mannered mountain
His answer is one possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position
Such dignity has to do crucially with a butler 's ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits
He will not be shaken out by external events however surprising alarming or vexing
Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of
Despite his racial advantage to be a great butler is a heroic calling one 's pantry is not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle
You see I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now
It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare For all its sad associations whenever I recall that evening today I find I do so with a large sense of triumph
We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow
That Stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent but funny and sad and enlightening is entirely the author 's triumph
Now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the England he has lived in for nearly thirty years he has fashioned a novel in the mode of Henry James and E. M. Forster
This employer embodies all that I find noble and admirable
I will hereafter devote myself to serving him
This is loyalty intelligently bestowed
In the end after meeting with the former housekeeper Stevens sits by the seashore at dusk thinking of her and of his employer and declares I trusted
I trusted in his lordship 's wisdom
I ca n't even say I made my own mistakes
Really one has to ask oneself what dignity is there in that
The loyal servant has come full circle
What is greatness
What is dignity
We understand such rueful wisdom must be retrospective The owl of Minerva only spreads her wings at dusk
But as The Remains of the Day so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity such wisdom can be movingly embodied in art

U. G. I. Corporation said its AmeriGas subsidiary completed the previously announced sale of its air separation plant and related assets in Waukesha Wisconsin to A. G. A. Gas Incorporated Cleveland
The price was n't disclosed
The transaction is part of U. G. I. 's continuing program to shed AmeriGas 's industrial gas interests and expand the subsidiary 's propane business
Since June AmeriGas has netted more than one hundred million dollars from industrial gas divestitures and reinvested more than fifty million dollars to acquire three propane distributors
U. G. I. is a gas and electric utility and distributes propane nationally through its AmeriGas subsidiary
Stanislav Ovcharenko who represents the Soviet airline Aeroflot here has some visions that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika
In his office overlooking the runway of Shannon Airport Mr. Ovcharenko enthusiastically throws out what he calls just ideas
First he suggests G. P. A. Group Limited the international aircraft leasing company based in Ireland could lease some of its Boeing jetliners to the Soviet airline
Then Aer Lingus the Irish flag carrier could teach Aeroflot pilots to fly the Boeings and the fleet could be based here at Shannon Airport
That 's not all he says
Aer Rianta the Irish airport authority could build a cargo terminal in the Soviet Union
Aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to Aer Lingus through G. P. A. for a joint venture cargo airline
And then there is his notion of an Irish Soviet charter airline to ferry Armenians to Los Angeles via Shannon
Have the freedoms of glasnost gone to Mr. Ovcharenko 's head
Hardly
The Irish Soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at Shannon Airport
G. P. A. is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about buying Soviet built Tupolev 204s
Aer Lingus is in discussions with the Soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities
Aer Rianta already has so many ventures with Aeroflot that its chief executive is studying Russian
Unlikely as it may seem tiny politically neutral Ireland has penetrated the mighty Soviet airline bureaucracy
And as Aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities the Irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit
Irish and Soviet people are similar says Mr. Ovcharenko
They look the same
They 're very friendly
Moreover he says Irish companies are small but spunky
We have to study their experience very well he says
We must find any way to get business
The two groups have been working together since the late nineteen seventies long before Soviet joint ventures were the rage in the West
Aeroflot carried about one hundred twenty five million passengers last year and Shannon Airport the airline 's largest transit airport outside the Soviet Union saw one thousand four hundred Aeroflot flights and two hundred fifty thousand passengers pass through
An apartment complex down the road is the crew rest and staging area for more than one hundred thirty Aeroflot pilots and flight attendants
The airport 's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the Soviet Union
Tankers from the Latvian port of Ventspils each year unload twenty five million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport
What Aeroflot does n't pour into its own gas guzzling Ilyushins is bartered to the airport authority which resells it to eleven Western carriers including Air France Trans World Airlines and Pakistan International Airlines
Aeroflot thus pays its landing fees ground handling and catering bills with fuel preserving its hard currency
That is n't all
Last year the Irish airport authority in a joint venture with Aeroflot opened four hard currency duty free shops at Moscow 's Sheremetyevo Airport
Aer Rianta now manages duty free sales on all Aeroflot international flights out of Moscow
Duty free shops in Leningrad 's Pulkova Airport opened in July and hard currency shops in Leningrad hotels and on the Soviet Finnish frontier are coming soon
Aer Rianta is talking about similar joint ventures in Tashkent and in Sochi a Black Sea resort and even has a computer assembly project cooking with the Georgian city of Tbilisi
Aeroflot 's international fleet of two hundred eighty five planes is being repainted and refurbished at Shannon Airport
The round trip fare to Havana is four hundred ten Irish punts five hundred seventy eight dollars
Jamaica costs five hundred four punts
A formal blessing of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in April when Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev stopped here for talks with Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey
New trade accords were signed
It all started with geography
When it opened in nineteen thirty nine Shannon was the first landfall in Europe for thirsty airplanes flying from North America
Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a Shannon stop unnecessary for most Western air fleets but Aeroflot still flies inefficient Ilyushins that ca n't make it from Moscow to Managua on one hop
As a result Ireland did n't spurn the Soviets after they shot down a Korean Air Lines jetliner over the Sea of Japan in nineteen eighty three though it suspended direct Moscow Shannon flights for two months
In fact Aer Lingus started ferrying Russians from Shannon to New York when Washington stripped Aeroflot of its U. S. landing rights
Today Aer Rianta is making a heap of money from its Soviet friendship
And with those contacts in place it could be relatively simple to add Aer Lingus and G. P. A. to the team
Then perhaps Mr. Ovcharenko 's ideas would n't sound like so much blarney
Britain 's industrial production rose one point five percent in August from July and was up zero point nine percent from August nineteen eighty eight according to provisional data from the Central Statistical Office
Output in the energy sector which can vary greatly with swings in the oil market rose three point eight percent in August from May but was down seven point one percent from a year earlier
The latest figures compare with July 's four point five percent month to month rise and eleven point three percent year to year fall
When Nucor Corporation begins shipping steel from the world 's first thin slab plant this month it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant competitors
The new technology which creates a very thin piece of steel radically reduces the costs of making flat rolled sheets
An ebullient Kenneth Iverson Nucor 's chairman says the company 's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in one point five man hours compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill
We 've had the Russians and Chinese and people from India visiting us Mr. Iverson beams
Everyone in the world is watching us very closely
Especially his neighbors the major U. S. steelmakers
Already U. S. X. Corporation and Armco Incorporated are studying Nucor 's technology to see if they can adopt it
Says the chief executive officer of a major Midwest steel company It 's damn worrisome
The once staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy turvy by a nineteen nineties technology revolution
New efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller less cash rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid decades ago
It also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat rolled steel market the major steelmakers ' largest most prized and until now untouchable market
But such thin slab technology is only the beginning
Eager engineers espouse direct steelmaking and direct casting which by the end of the nineteen nineties will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces
Those massive structures while posing cost and environmental headaches effectively locked out all but deep pocketed giants from steelmaking
There 's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel says William Dennis vice president manufacturing and technology for the American Iron Ore and Steel Institute
It is n't that major steelmakers have blithely ignored high technology
In fact they 've spent billions of dollars to boost the percentage of continously cast steel to sixty point nine percent in nineteen eighty eight from thirty nine point six percent five years before
Moreover their balance sheets are rich with diversity their old plants shuttered and work forces lean
But that wo n't suffice
It 's no longer enough to beat the guy down the street
You have to beat everyone around the world says Mr. Dennis
He wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence
The problem They 're saddled with huge plants that require costly maintenance
And try plying new dollars free in a market that is softening hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity the industry 's Darth Vadar
The technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers says Peter Marcus an analyst with PaineWebber Incorporated
They 've got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their workers to be flexible
No one expects minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers who remain the undisputed kings of highest quality steel used for autos and refrigerators
Still flat rolled is the steel industry 's bread and butter representing about half of the eighty million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year
Moreover the process is n't without its headaches
Because all operations are connected one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown
On some days the Nucor plant does n't produce anything
Indeed with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity steelmakers will have to change the way they do business
In the past says Armco 's chief economist John Corey steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock
We said We 've got a product if you want it you can buy it he says adding Now we 're figuring out what people need and are going back to make it
Armco 's sales representatives visit the General Motors Corporation 's Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas City Missouri two or three days a week
When they determined that G. M. needed parts more quickly Armco convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within fifteen minutes
Cementing such relationships with major clients car and appliance makers is a means of survival especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers
But steelmakers must also find new markets
After letting aluminum makers take the recycling lead a group of the nation 's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation
Battelle 's Mr. McCall thinks steelmakers should concentrate more on construction
Weirton Steel Corporation Weirton W. Virginia for example is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors with leaded glass inserts as a secure and energy efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones
Other steelmakers envision steel roofs covering suburbia
Still others are looking at overseas markets
U. S. X. is funneling drilling pipe to steel hungry Soviet Union
This year the nation 's largest steelmaker reactivated its overseas sales operation
Producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher profit output such as coated and electrogalvanized products which remain beyond the reach of minimills
Almost all capital improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building electrogalvanizing lines used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors
But unfortunately that segment is much smaller than the bread and butter flat rolled steel
It 's like everyone climbing out of the Q. E. Two and getting into a lifeboat says John Jacobson an analyst with A. U. S. Consultants
After a while someone has to go over the side
Although he does n't expect any bankruptcies he does see more plants being sold or closed
Robert Crandall with the Brookings Institute agrees
Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar it 's unlikely that consumption of U. S. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills
Not to mention the incursion of imports
Japanese and European steelmakers which have led the recent technology developments are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in nineteen ninety two
Moreover the U. S. can expect more competition from low cost producing Pacific Rim and Latin American countries
A Taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans to build a Nucor like plant
People think of the steel business as an old and mundane smokestack business says Mr. Iverson
They 're dead wrong

Polaroid Corporation 's patent infringement damages case against Eastman Kodak Company one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever is getting scant attention on Wall Street
After seventy eight days of mind numbing testimony in federal court in Boston the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys
Most have read the pre trial documents however and estimate Kodak will be ordered to pay one billion to one point five billion dollars for infringing on seven Polaroid patents
That may be the largest patent award ever but it is well below the twelve billion dollars Polaroid seeks
The two companies later agreed to settle for ninety five million dollars
Few analysts think it is worth their time to slog through the Polaroid trial testimony
It 's like panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station
You might find something but the chances are low said Michael Ellman an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co
A seventy five day trial in the early nineteen eighties determined that Kodak based in Rochester N. Y. infringed on patents of Polaroid of Cambridge Mass
The main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was willful and deliberate
If so the damages could be tripled
Mr. Crary said testimony by Kodak 's patent counsel Francis T. Carr of Kenyon & Kenyon showed that he worked with Kodak continuously from the outset of the project in an effort to avoid infringement
Carr told Kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of Polaroid 's patent positions and Kodak followed his advice in every instance Mr. Crary said
But Irving Kayton a patent expert at George Mason University School of Law who is familiar with the case said the fact that seven patents were infringed suggests that infringement was willful
It 's difficult to be that consistently wrong
Observers also wonder whether Judge Mazzone will use the lost profits method of determining damages which Polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award or the reasonable royalty method
Polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by Kodak if Kodak had n't entered the market
Moreover Polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price and thus made higher profits because it would n't have been forced to match Kodak 's lower prices
Each side has called a Harvard Business School professor to testify on that issue
Kodak hired Robert Buzzell and Polaroid brought in Robert J. Dolan
There 's nothing that says that people at Harvard Business school have to agree with each other said Mr. Buzzell
Testimony is expected to continue until early December
A decision is n't expected until some time next year
International Business Machines Corporation said earnings tumbled thirty percent in the third quarter even a bit further than expected rendering the outlook doubtful for the next few quarters
The main reason was a delay in shipment of new high end disk drives a business that accounts for some ten percent of I. B. M. 's sixty billion dollars of annual revenue
I. B. M. which telegraphed the poor results three weeks ago also cited an increase in its leasing business which tends to lock in business long term but cut revenue in the near term
In addition I. B. M. noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars
Earnings fell to eight hundred seventy seven million dollars or one dollar and fifty one cents a share somewhat below securities analysts ' revised expectations of around one dollar and sixty cents a share
Revenue climbed four point three percent to fourteen point three one billion dollars from thirteen point seven one billion dollars
I. B. M. Armonk N. Y. remained upbeat
The computer giant whose U. S. results have been dismal for years noted that revenue rose again in the U. S. in the third quarter following an increase in the second period
The company said in a statement that demand for I. B. M. products and services continues to be good world wide
We do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth
Securities analysts however remained downbeat
I think nineteen ninety will be another mediocre year said Steve Milunovich of First Boston
Mr. Stevens said he kept a buy hold recommendation on the stock only because all the damage has been done
He said the stock has n't traded below one and a half times book value over the past ten years which at the moment computes to a stock price of one hundred dollars
The stock closed yesterday at one hundred three dollars a share up just one dollar in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as the market surged
Analysts worry that the disk drive and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter
A key part of the question is how soon does this disk drive come and how soon does production ramp up said Steve Cohen at SoundView Financial Group
And the input I 've had from customers is that it still could be a while
On leasing Bob Djurdjevic at Annex Research said he thinks I. B. M. has hurt itself unnecessarily
He said I. B. M. has priced its leases aggressively thinking that would help win business
But he said I. B. M. would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer
He said I. B. M. has not only hurt its short term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases
I. B. M. is expected to get a boost soon when it announces some new versions of its mainframes
But the basic technology in the line is almost five years old which means it is long in the tooth and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own
I. B. M. is gaining momentum in the personal computer market and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations early next year
But it 's hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal computer business these days and the workstation market while important is too small to rely on for much growth
The disk drives will doubtless sell well when they finally become available
But the AS four hundred I. B. M. 's highly successful minicomputer line is losing its momentum and some analysts said sales could even decline in the fourth quarter
In addition I. B. M. 's growth in software in the third quarter was just eight point eight percent well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect last year 's payment from Fujitsu and the stronger dollar
And expenses up seven point nine percent in the quarter have stayed stubbornly high
Revenue increased six point five percent to forty two point two five billion dollars from thirty nine point six eight billion dollars
PepsiCo Incorporated 's chairman said he is more than comfortable with analysts ' estimates that third quarter earnings rose to at least ninety eight cents to one dollar a share from ninety one cents the year earlier
D. Wayne Calloway also chief executive officer of the company indicated that he expects analysts to raise their forecasts for nineteen eighty nine after the company releases its earnings today
So far analysts have said they are looking for three point three zero to three dollars and thirty five cents a share
After today 's announcement that range could increase to three point three five to three dollars and forty cents a share
The official said he also would be comfortable with that new range
In nineteen eighty eight the soft drink giant earned two dollars and ninety cents a share
Results for nineteen eighty nine will include about forty cents a share from the dilutive effects of snack food and bottling company acquisitions
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange the company closed yesterday at fifty seven point one two five dollars a share up three point one two five dollars
The company said third quarter sales are expected to increase twenty five percent from three point one two billion dollars of last year 's third quarter
Mr. Calloway blamed the slower volume on rainier weather a dearth of new products in the industry and to a much lesser extent pricing
PepsiCo said its soft drink prices were about two percent higher in the quarter
Mr. Calloway also noted that soft drink volume rose a hefty nine percent in last year 's third quarter making the comparison more difficult
International soft drink volume was up about six percent
Snack food tonnage increased a strong seven percent in the third quarter while domestic profit increased in double digits Mr. Calloway said
Excluding the British snack food business acquired in July snack food international tonnage jumped forty percent with sales strong in Spain Mexico and Brazil
Total snack food profit rose thirty percent
Led by Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant earnings increased about twenty five percent in the third quarter on a twenty two percent sales increase
Same store sales for Pizza Hut rose about thirteen percent while Taco Bell 's increased twenty two percent as the chain continues to benefit from its price value strategy
Taco Bell has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its tacos
Same store sales for Kentucky Fried Chicken which has struggled with increased competition in the fast food chicken market and a lack of new products rose only one percent
The operation which has been slow to respond to consumers ' shifting tastes away from fried foods has been developing a grilled chicken product that may be introduced nationally at the end of next year
The new product has performed well in a market test in Las Vegas Nevada Mr. Calloway said
But You never can tell he added you have to take advantage of opportunities
President Bush chose Martin Allday a longtime friend from Texas to be chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
Mr. Allday would succeed Martha Hesse who is resigning
The White House said Ms. Hesse a Chicago businesswoman who previously held posts at the Energy Department and F. E. R. C. is leaving to become a vice president of First Chicago Corporation
Mr. Allday an attorney in Midland Texas has been solicitor at the Interior Department
He met Mr. Bush in the nineteen fifties when the president was a young oil man in Midland and Mr. Allday was a lawyer for an oil firm
The F. E. R. C. is a five member commission that regulates billions of dollars of interstate wholesale energy transactions
Mr. Allday 's appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate
Administration officials said a date for Ms. Hesse 's departure has n't been set
CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT Corporation said its directors declared a dividend of five cents per Class A common stock payable November sixth to stock of record October sixteenth
The company said it hopes to resume its schedule of regular quarterly dividends at the end of this year
Hydro Quebec said it notified Central Maine Power Company it will cancel a four billion dollars contract to supply electricity to the Maine utility
The provincially owned utility said it is tearing up the deal because the contract 's objectives ca n't be fulfilled
Hydro Quebec said Maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through Maine to other utilities
It would now be physically impossible to begin deliveries in nineteen ninety two a Hydro Quebec official said
The contract was to run from nineteen ninety two to two thousand twenty
Under the contract Hydro Quebec was to supply four hundred megawatts of power to Central Maine Power starting in nineteen ninety two six hundred megawatts starting in nineteen ninety five and nine hundred megawatts starting in
Hydro Quebec said Maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract means Central Maine Power has lost its place in line
We wo n't sign any new contracts with deliveries beginning earlier than two thousand oh the Hydro Quebec official said
He said Hydro Quebec already has some customers in mind for the power that was to be delivered to Maine
Central Maine said it is evaluating many energy options to make up for the lost future power including new energy generation and management proposals from New England and possibly new Canadian purchases
CHICAGO Options traders were among the big victims of Friday 's plunging stock market including one small firm that required an emergency fifty million dollars bailout
While Monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses many options customers and professional traders in stock index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion dollar losses traders here and in New York said
Thus options traders Friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in New York
Jeffrey Miller of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market it is very easy for these guys to get wiped out
That may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures
An options contract gives the holder the right to buy call or sell put a specific amount of stock or in this case the value of a stock index based on a predetermined price within a given time period
They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices in most cases at a substantial loss
The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of Black Monday when investors fled the market because of huge losses
Making matters worse was the fact that late Friday afternoon the C. B. O. E. halted stock index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's halt in stock index futures
But while the Merc reopened a half hour later the C. B. O. E. remained closed leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses
C. B. O. E. Chairman Alger Duke Chapman said that unlike the futures market the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade
The damage was so bad at Fossett Corporation an options trading firm here that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago a unit of Continental Bank Corporation as a result of options trading losses
Fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of Friday 's rout
Fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after Friday 's close of trading but not enough that regulators worried about another potential market plunge yesterday would let it reopen for trading options exchange officials said
S. Waite Rawls the Third vice chairman of Continental Bank First Options ' parent company said the firm took on about one hundred sixty accounts formerly held by Fossett almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders
Steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money Mr. Rawls said
A package of credit support was put together including the assets of Steve and his firm
The bailout was cobbled together over the weekend with officials from the Federal Reserve Board Securities and Exchange Commission Comptroller of the Currency and Treasury as well as the options exchanges
It was great to have the luxury of time Mr. Rawls said
At one point an options industry official had to talk the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 's night watchman into giving him the home phone number of Silas Keene Chicago Fed president
First Options did n't have to put any money into the bailout
Yesterday 's rally in the stock futures and options markets led C. B. O. E. and Amex officials to conclude that the fifty million dollars in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by First Options
The Fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the October nineteen eighty seven crash as well Mr. Rawls said
A federal official said that Continental Bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the Fossett bailout but that conditions were n't dictated by those agencies
It was their business decision the official said
Officials at Options Clearing Corporation which processes all options trades for U. S. exchanges said that the fifty million dollars guarantee was unprecedented but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets
It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps said Paul Stevens O. C. C. president and chief operating officer
Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the fifty million dollars guarantee from each participant
Mr. Fossett could n't be reached to comment
Debora Foster takes off her necklace settles herself on a padded chair and gently leans forward
With a jazz piano tape playing softly in the background the soothing hands of Sabina Vidunas begin to work on Ms. Foster 's neck and shoulders
It 's like an oasis in this room Ms. Foster purrs
The room in question is the directors ' lounge of H. J. Heinz Company sixty floors above the bustle of Pittsburgh
There amid oil paintings and marble tables massages are administered every Wednesday
On days that I 'm really busy says Ms. Foster who works in public relations for the company it seems decadent to take time off for a massage
Although such sessions may never replace coffee breaks on site massage as it is known in the trade is certainly infiltrating corporate America
In some companies middle managers sneak massage therapists into the office fearful that upper level executives wo n't approve
Ms. Foster 's indulgence is nothing like the oily hour long rubfests enjoyed by spa visitors
Nor does it at all resemble despite what some executives think the more intimate variety offered at specialty parlors in bad parts of town
On the contrary office rubdowns usually take place in dimly lighted conference rooms where stressed out employees relax in specially designed chairs fully clothed
The massages last fifteen minutes and typically cost about ten dollars
Some companies including Heinz even pay part of the fee
Ms. Vidunas has been seeing some fifteen clients a visit since the program was started at Heinz last year
Anthony J. F. O'Reilly the company 's chairman swears by her firm touch saying regular massages are a balm for his old football injuries
Massage advocates say that kneading the head shoulders neck and back can go a long way toward easing tension and improving morale
They also insist that touching is a basic need as powerful as the need for food or sleep and that the office is as good a place as any to do it
When you leave the room after your massage people say you look like you 're glowing
Adds Candice Ohlman the thirty five year old masseuse who plies her trade in the Grand Rapids office They fall in love with my hands
Not everyone however is at ease with office massage
Three years ago the Internal Revenue Service 's office in San Jose California opened its doors to on site massage
And even though employees paid the bill taxpayers grumbled
Sometimes with the release of stress you hear oohs and ahs coming out of the room explains Morgan Banks the agency 's health specialist
And you ca n't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing oohs and ahs
Last month the complaints intensified and the massages ended
Now we 're looking for a room with thicker walls Ms. Banks says
Massage also has an image problem to contend with
Some masseurs have tried to get around this by calling themselves bodyworkers and describing their office visits as reinvigoration breaks
But massage no matter how chaste is still associated in many minds with seedy fronts for prostitution and that makes some executives nervous
Last year the research and development division of Weyerhaeuser Company the large wood products concern invited a masseuse to its Tacoma Washington offices
Phil Harms a software engineer was an eager customer
You build up a lot of tension working at a terminal all day he says
But after about eight months the vice president of the division Ed Soule learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt
Mr. Soule says his only beef was that the massages were being given in a company conference room the department 's supervised health facility would have been fine
In my view massages should be managed with an appropriate mixture of males and females around he says
Given such attitudes some corporate masseurs prefer to go about their business quietly
Russell Borner of Park Ridge N. J. says he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in New York unbeknownst to the company 's executives
He visits the same department every two or three weeks
His massage chair is kept in a closet and a secretary escorts him past security
This is common with a lot of large companies says Mr. Borner who worked for American Telephone & Telegraph Company for twenty three years before choosing his current trade
Managers he contends are afraid how they 're going to look in the eyes of their peers
My vision is to change human consciousness towards touch
My attitude is Let 's come out of the closet
Occasionally all that 's needed is a little coaxing
Elisa Byler a Street Louis masseuse won over officials at Emerson Electric Company a maker of electrical and electronic equipment by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage
She notes that she also stresses professionalism during her weekly visits
I pull my hair back wear a little makeup and look corporate says Ms. Byler who has been visiting Emerson since January
If I go in there as I normally dress they 'd ask Who is this hippie
The self proclaimed father of on site massage is David Palmer a forty one year old San Francisco masseur whose mission is to save the touch starved masses
To help do this Mr. Palmer developed a portable massage chair three years ago that he hopes will bring structured touching into mainstream America
The culture is not ready to take off its clothes lie down and be touched for an hour for forty five dollars he says
The idea is to keep the clothes on and to keep people seated
The chair is a way to package massage
Sitting in one of Mr. Palmer 's chairs which cost four hundred twenty five dollars and have since been copied by others is a bit like straddling a recliner
Customers lean forward rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of the chair
Ms. Ohlman the Grand Rapids masseuse says she has heard the odd looking contraption compared to something out of the Spanish Inquisition
Scot MacInnis a masseur in Boulder Colorado had a scary experience while massaging a man in a natural foods supermarket as part of a store promotion
Three minutes into the massage the man curled up began shaking and turned red
Paramedics were called
A week later the man told Mr. MacInnis he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage
It was a powerful point in my career says the thirty one year old Mr. MacInnis who has since taken out a one million dollars liability policy for his business
But he pulled through and after the ambulance left there were still six people in line waiting for a massage
The next woman was older and I was afraid to touch her
But it 's like falling off a horse and getting back on
Despite the number of fans that office massage has won some purists look down on it arguing that naked full body rubs are the only way to go
Linda Aldridge who does full body work in Pittsburgh says that while on site massage is better than nothing tired workers should realize it is only the tip of the iceberg
Whole areas of their bodies are neglected she says adding that clothes ruin the experience
There 's nothing like skin to skin
In what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to China since the June fourth killings in Beijing an international bank syndicate has terminated a fifty five million dollars credit for a Shanghai property project
The syndicate led by Schroders Asia Limited agreed last November to provide the loan to Asia Development Corporation a U. S. property developer
But several weeks ago in the wake of the Beijing killings the loan was canceled according to bankers and executives close to the project
Asia Development and Schroders declined to comment on the move
Lenders had doubts about the project even before June fourth but the harsh crackdown which caused many businesses to reassess their China transactions gave the banks the out they wanted says an official close to the Shanghai venture
The decision to cancel the loan exemplifies the tough attitude bankers have taken toward China since June fourth
While some commercial lending has resumed international lenders remain nervous about China 's economic troubles and foreign debt forty billion dollars at the end of nineteen eighty eight
Many loans are being renegotiated especially those tied to the hotel sector which has been hit hard by a post June four tourism slump
Many bankers view property sector loans as particularly risky
The canceled Shanghai loan leaves Asia Development a small concern saddled with a half completed thirty two story apartment building and heavy debts
The company owes eleven million dollars to the Shui On Group the project 's Hong Kong contractor and a significant though unspecified amount in legal fees to Coudert Brothers a U. S. law firm the sources say
The project known as Lotus Mansion has been mired in controversy
When the loan agreement was announced it was hailed as one of the first Western style financing transactions ever used in China
Unlike most loans to China there was no Chinese guarantor
Instead the banks secured a promise from state owned Bank of Communications that it would lend Asia Development the entire fifty five million dollars at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing
The loan was to have matured in just two to three years as soon as construction was completed
Creditors involved in the project contend however that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations
Instead the creditors say the loan fell victim to nervousness about China 's political turmoil as well as to concern about the loan 's security
The bank syndicate is made up mostly of European banks but it includes China 's state owned Citic Industrial Bank
The eleven banks in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn down
K mart Corporation agreed to acquire Pace Membership Warehouse Incorporated for twenty three dollars a share or three hundred twenty two million dollars in a move to expand its presence in the rapidly growing warehouse club business
The proposed merger comes as K mart 's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as Wal Mart Stores Incorporated
K mart based in Troy Michigan recently said net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter after a sixteen percent drop in the first half of its current fiscal year
The membership warehouse club concept has great potential the company 's chairman Joseph E. Antonini said in a statement
Warehouse clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products which they sell for close to wholesale prices in no frills stores
Shoppers many of whom operate small businesses pay annual membership fees which provide an income base for the stores
K mart tested the warehouse club sector last year with its acquisition of a fifty one percent interest in Makro Incorporated
Six year old Pace based in Aurora Colorado operates forty one warehouse club stores
The company had losses for several years before turning profitable in fiscal nineteen eighty eight
Warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off
But some analysts contend K mart has agreed to pay too much for Pace
Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation it 's expensive said Wayne Hood of Prudential Bache Securities Incorporated
In my opinion you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry
Ms. McGlade of PaineWebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal
If K mart ca n't get its act together in discounting why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets
She said I would say K mart 's number one job is to address its market share loss in discount stores which longer term will lead to improved profit margins
At that point perhaps diversification would be appropriate
But K mart 's Mr. Antonini is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses
For instance K mart is opening big food and general merchandise stores called hypermarkets and warehouse type stores specializing in office products and sporting goods
It also operates Waldenbooks Pay Less Drug Stores and Builders Square home improvement stores
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange K mart closed yesterday at thirty six dollars a share up twelve point five cents
Pace rose two point six two five dollars to close at twenty two point one two five dollars a share in national over the counter trading
A K mart spokesman said the acquisition would be financed with short term borrowings
Under terms of the agreement a K mart subsidiary will soon make a tender offer for Pace shares
Among the conditions of the offer is that Pace shareholders tender a majority of the company 's shares outstanding
The companies said Pace would ill continue to operate under its present management
G. William Ryan president of Post Newsweek Stations was named chief executive officer of the unit of this media company effective January first

Traders nervously watching their Quotron electronic data machines yesterday morning were stunned to see the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummet ninety nine points in seconds
A minute later it soared one hundred twenty eight points then zoomed back down one hundred thirteen points sixty nine below Friday 's close
It was crazy said Neil Weisman general partner of Chilmark Capital Corporation
It was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane
But those who said This ca n't be happening were right
The Quotrons were wrong
The prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct Quotron said but the average was wrong
Meanwhile there was an awful lot of confusion
Is the market up or down
At the time Quotron was reporting that the industrial average was down seventy points
In fact it was up twenty four
Holly Stark a vice president who heads the trading desk at Dillon Read Capital Corporation said that once she figured out the Quotron numbers were wrong she called brokers to tell them
It 's been kind of annoying to say the least she said
That was the New York Stock Exchange 's blooper
A spokesman cited a technical error and declined to elaborate
And there were other blunders
When the market opened at nine thirty a. m. E. S. T. a reporter for the Reuters newswire miscalculated the industrial average 's drop as a four percent decline when it really was down zero point seven percent
It was a case of human error which we found almost immediately and corrected a spokesman for Reuter in New York said
Meanwhile some currency traders at West German banks in Frankfurt said they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices
But it was the Quotron problems that had lingering effects
Dillon Read 's Ms. Stark said in early afternoon that she was still viewing prices and other data as subject to verification and she said portfolio managers continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen
It was the second time in less than a week that Quotron has had problems calculating the industrial average
At the start of trading last Wednesday the average appeared to plunge more than two hundred points
Actually it was down only a few points at the time
Quotron said that snafu which lasted nine minutes resulted from a failure to adjust for a four for one stock split at Philip Morris Cos
A Quotron spokeswoman said recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday 's problems
She said Quotron switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected
Today of all days she lamented
The eyes of the world were watching us
Steven F. Kaplan was named a senior vice president of this graphics equipment company
He retains his current positions as chief strategic officer of AM International and president of AM Ventures
Houston attorney Dale Friend representing a plaintiff in a damage suit says he has negotiated a settlement that will strike a blow for his client
Literally
It turns out Mr. Friend 's client Machelle Parks of Cincinnati did n't like the way defense attorney Tom Alexander acted during the legal proceedings
So she has agreed to forgo monetary damages against Mr. Alexander 's client in return for the right to punch the attorney
Ms. Parks 's mother also gets to cuff Mr. Alexander
So does Mr. Friend and his law partner Nick Nichols
Last month Mr. Friend says Mr. Alexander 's associate agreed that Derr would pay fifty thousand dollars as part of an overall settlement
But Mr. Alexander scuttled the deal at the last minute angering the plaintiff 's side
I never agreed to it Mr. Alexander says adding that it 's not necessary to pay these nuisance settlements
When Ms. Parks and her mother heard about what had happened Mr. Friend says they volunteered that they would like to give Mr. Alexander a good walloping
Mr. Friend says he passed that along to his adversary and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which Derr could keep its money and the plaintiffs could take a shot at Mr. Alexander
Although time and place have yet to be determined some details are in place
Mr. Friend says he agreed to strike Mr. Alexander above the belt
Ms. Parks and her mother indicated they want to catch him unawares from behind he says
Mr. Alexander for his part insisted that the punchers ca n't assign their pummeling rights to anyone else ca n't use a blunt instrument and ca n't take a running start
Mr. Alexander says he regards the agreement which has n't been submitted to a judge as something of a joke
However he acknowledges they have the option of taking a swat at me if they really want to
Mr. Friend says his side is dead serious
Although they do n't contemplate delivering any disabling blows he says that Mr. Alexander will be asked to sign a release from liability just in case
After two years of drought it rained money in the stock index futures markets yesterday
As financial markets rebounded trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's huge Standard & Poor 's five hundred stock index futures pit soared reaching near record levels for the first time since October nineteen eighty seven
The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared traders said
Guys were minting money in there today said John Legittino a futures broker for Elders Futures Incorporated in Chicago
Each index point represents a five hundred dollars profit for each S. & P. five hundred contract held
For the first time since the nineteen eighty seven crash traders said that they were able to trade several hundred S. & P. five hundred contracts at a time in a highly liquid market
Many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock index futures blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago
Since the crash many futures traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the S. & P. five hundred market with much of its customer order flow missing would dry up if prices turned against them
More than four hundred traders jammed the S. & P. five hundred futures pit to await the opening bell
Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at eight thirty am
The contract fell five points at the open to three hundred twenty three point eight five the maximum opening move allowed under safeguards adopted by the Merc to stem a market slide
But several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts driving prices sharply higher
The market hovered near Friday 's closing price of three hundred twenty eight point eight five for about a half hour moving several index points higher or lower in seconds then broke higher and did n't look back
The S. & P. five hundred contract that expires in December closed up a record fifteen point six five points on volume of nearly eighty thousand contracts
Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart said one S. & P. five hundred broker
You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune he marveled
Several of Wall Street 's largest securities firms including Salomon Brothers Incorporated and PaineWebber Incorporated were also large buyers traders said
Salomon Brothers was among the largest sellers of stock index futures last week traders said
Brokerage firms as a rule do n't comment on their market activity
Unlike the week following Black Monday two years ago individual traders in the S. & P. five hundred pit were also being uncharacteristically circumspect about their one day profits
The market for two hundred billion dollars of high yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from Friday 's plunge
But the junk recovery led by the bellwether R. J. R. Holdings bonds was precarious
No trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds securities industry officials said
On Friday trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues
Nothing traded on Friday and people were n't really sure where the market should have opened yesterday said Raymond Minella co head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co
But we had a fairly active day yesterday
At Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated the leading underwriter of junk bonds I was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight said David Feinman a junk bond trader
Now I feel maybe there 's a little bit of euphoria
But before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell off yesterday he said You could n't buy junk bonds and you could n't give them away
Bonds issued by Kroger Duracell Safeway and American Standard also showed big gains recovering almost all their losses from Friday and early yesterday
Liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market said Mr. Minella of Merrill
The deadbeats are still deadbeats said Mr. Feinman of Drexel
Analysts are concerned that much of the high yield market will remain treacherous for investors
Mark Bachmann a senior vice president at Standard & Poor 's Corporation confirms that there is increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market
Junk bonds are a highly stratified market said Lewis Glucksman vice chairman of Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co
There 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good
Analysts at Standard & Poor 's say junk bond offerings by tightly stretched issuers seem to be growing
You could still have some very bad times ahead said Mr. Bachmann
It 's possible to have a ten percent default rate in one year because we 're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy
I 'm certainly not comfortable saying we 've seen the bottom
But yesterday 's rally among good junk was a badly needed tonic for the market
Many issues bounced off the floor Mr. Minella said and benchmark junk issues recovered all of their losses from Friday and early yesterday
In contrast he says The stock market gained back only about half what it lost Friday and the government bond market lost about half what it gained Friday
Traders said yesterday 's rally was fueled by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month
In addition mutual funds did n't appear to be major sellers of high yield securities as was expected
Sometimes a shakeout is healthy said Drexel 's Mr. Feinman
People will learn to be more circumspect
If they do good credit analysis they will avoid the hand grenades
I think the market is in good shape
Should you really own stocks
That 's a question a lot of people are asking following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility
Whipsawed financially and emotionally by Friday 's heartstopping one hundred ninety point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and yesterday 's eighty eight point rebound they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market
The answer say academic researchers money managers and investment specialists is yes as long as you approach the stock market as an investor
But they say people should n't try to be traders who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock
The case for owning stocks over the long term is compelling
The longer the time period the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market
Over time the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio
If you do n't need the money for ten years there 's a clear cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks Mr. Gregory says
Stock market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns says John Blankenship Junior president of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners
Stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate bonds international securities and cash he says
There are some important caveats Before investing in stocks individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank most investment advisers say
Individuals also should focus on building equity in a home which provides some protection against inflation as well as a nest egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living
People also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future for example for college tuition payments or retirement expenses
You may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge says Mr. Blankenship a Del Mar California financial planner
But once the basics are covered then I would start to invest even if it 's as little as one thousand dollars says Michael Lipper president of Lipper Analytical Services Incorporated
He says individuals should consider not just stocks but other long term investments such as high quality bonds
Despite the strong case for stocks however most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short term developments
It 's very difficult to do says Donald Holt a market strategist for Wedbush Morgan Securities a Los Angeles brokerage firm
Our markets move so fast and they are so volatile there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros
Individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market
And assuming their first investment is successful investors will have to pay taxes on their gains
That can reduce returns by a third or more once local taxes are included Mr. Lipper says
After that individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing
It 's very tough for most individuals to out trade the mutual funds or the market says Mr. Lipper
You should really think twice if you think you can out smart the system
Then too many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market
So what 's the best way to buy stocks
Still he adds I could see owning both given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in spotting special situations based on their own insights he adds
George Douglas first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated says that individuals have a particular edge now in small to medium size niche companies with exciting earnings prospects a traditional stomping ground for small investors
This growth sector which usually carries a price earnings multiple about twice that of the Standard & Poor 's five hundred happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now
It 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market says Mr. Douglas
Moreover Mr. Douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term
Many big Wall Street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now resuming coverage of this area he notes
We 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks he says
The pros strenuously advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad
They say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes
Friday 's correction presents a pretty good buying opportunity but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle says Carmine Grigoli chief equity portfolio strategist at First Boston Corporation
Buy stocks on weakness for their long term fundamentals he says
In the long run investment advisers say most investors will be better off using the dollar cost averaging method of buying stocks
In this method a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down
That cuts the risk Mr. Gregory the San Francisco money manager points out
When the market is low you are buying more shares and when it 's high you 're buying fewer shares he says
Otherwise if you put all your money in at one time by sheer bad luck you might pick a terrible time and have to wait three years to get even Mr. Gregory says
A disciplined program will work the best Mr. Boesel says
One of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down he says
But that 's just the time when you should be buying them

Donald Trump who faced rising doubt about his bid for American Airlines parent A. M. R. Corporation even before a United Airlines buy out came apart Friday withdrew his seven point five four billion dollars offer
But a lower bid could face rejection by the U. A. L. board
Mr. Trump who vowed Wednesday to go forward with the bid said he was dropping it in light of the recent change in market conditions
He said he might now sell his A. M. R. stake buy more shares or make another offer at a lower price
News about U. A. L. and A. M. R. whose shares never reopened after trading was halted Friday for the U. A. L. announcement sent both stocks nosediving in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Together the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock traders and caused a seven point three percent drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average second in size only to the stock market crash of October nineteenth nineteen eighty seven
Some said Friday 's market debacle had given Mr. Trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the U. A. L. deal
Some takeover stock traders had been betting against Mr. Trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets then selling at a profit without making a bid
He still has n't proven his mettle as a big league take out artist said airline analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley & Co
He 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it
He 's written this book The Art of the Deal
Why does n't he just follow through on one of these things
Mr. Trump withdrew his bid before the A. M. R. board which is due to meet tomorrow ever formally considered it
A. M. R. had weighed a wide range of possible responses from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy outs that might have included either employees a friendlier buyer such as Texas billionaire Robert Bass or both
A. M. R. had also sought to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the Transportation Department to reject airline buy outs
Yesterday Mr. Trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the U. A. L. deal on Congress saying it was rushing through a bill to protect A. M. R. executives
A. M. R. declined to comment and Mr. Trump did n't respond to requests for interviews
Mr. Trump never said how much A. M. R. stock he had bought only that his holdings were substantial
However he only received federal clearance to buy more than fifteen million dollars of the stock on September twentieth when the price rose two dollars a share to seventy eight dollars and fifty cents
Between then and his bid on October fifth the price fluctuated between seventy five point six two five dollars and eighty seven point three seven five dollars
In an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just a stock play Mr. Trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares
A. M. R. was trading at around eighty four dollars yesterday before his withdrawal announcement then immediately fell to about seventy six dollars
However other knowledgeable observers said they believed Mr. Crandall and the A. M. R. board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps
Some analysts said they believed Mr. Trump whose towering ego had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out might come back with a lower bid
Ray Neidl of Dillon Read & Company said Mr. Trump is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle
I 'm sure he still wants A. M. R.
But others remained skeptical
I was never sure Donald Trump really wanted to take A. M. R. said John Mattis a bond analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated
What happened with United was a gracious way for him to bow out
Mr. Trump never obtained financing for his bid
That skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would handicap him in any effort to oust the board in a proxy fight
Meanwhile Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corporation the two lead lenders on the U. A. L. buy out met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy out at a lower price
Officials familiar with the talks said Citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to two hundred fifty dollars a share but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made
At two hundred fifty dollars a share the group would have to borrow about six point one billion dollars from banks
The first U. A. L. deal unraveled after Citibank and Chase could n't raise seven point two billion dollars
Citibank and Chase had agreed to commit three billion dollars and said they were highly confident of raising another four point two billion dollars
Together Citicorp and Chase received eight million dollars in fees to raise the rest of the financing
But other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the U. A. L. group was willing to pay them
Nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next forty eight hours despite the hopes of many traders
The group 's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around
Even if the buy out group is able to obtain financing the transaction still faces obstacles
U. A. L. 's board could reject the new price as too low especially since there are n't any competing bids
In addition the coalition of labor and management longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of Mr. Davis 's bid could break apart now
The group 's resilience gets its first test today when thirty top pilot union leaders convene outside Chicago in a previously scheduled meeting
Union Chairman F. C. Rick Dubinsky faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy out the members approved overwhelmingly last week
The pilot union is vowing to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides
But if the board rejects a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives it could transform what has been a harmonious process into an adversarial one
The pilots could play hardball by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes
Also because U. A. L. Chairman Stephen Wolf and other U. A. L. executives have joined the pilots ' bid the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders
That could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder
Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings and loan bailout agency can raise capital creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts
The bill intends to restrict the R. T. C. to Treasury borrowings only unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization
Such agency self help borrowing is unauthorized and expensive far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing said Representative Fortney Stark D. California the bill 's chief sponsor
The complex financing plan in the S. & L. bailout law includes raising thirty billion dollars from debt issued by the newly created R. T. C.
This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit
Another twenty billion dollars would be raised through Treasury bonds which pay lower interest rates
But the R. T. C. also requires working capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold until the assets can be sold separately
That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold leaving the total spending for the bailout at fifty billion dollars or one hundred sixty six billion dollars including interest over ten years
It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved said David Cooke executive director of the R. T. C.
The agency has already spent roughly nineteen billion dollars selling thirty four insolvent S&Ls and it is likely to sell or merge six hundred by the time the bailout concludes
Absent other working capital he said the R. T. C. would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets
We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward he said
The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight
The law does allow the R. T. C. to borrow from the Treasury up to five billion dollars at any time
That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means which seems to me sort of draconian he said
The R. T. C. is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility
The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday
We 're about to see if advertising works
Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October
Just days after the nineteen eighty seven crash major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors
This time around they 're moving even faster
PaineWebber Incorporated filmed a new television commercial at four p. m. E. D. T. yesterday and had it on the air by last night
Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday and wrote another new ad appearing today
Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated by yesterday afternoon had already written new T. V. ads
It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday
Other brokerage firms including Merrill Lynch & Company were plotting out potential new ad strategies
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic
This time the firms were ready
Fidelity for example prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge
When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers
The ads touted Fidelity 's automated eight hundred number beneath the huge headline Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call
A Fidelity spokesman says the eight hundred line which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend
A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us he says
To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial
It would have been too late to think about on Friday
We had to think about it ahead of time
Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity
Underneath the headline Diversification it counsels Based on the events of the past week all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility
It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name
PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the nineteen eighty seven crash
It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which C. N. N. would agree to air its last minute creations
The new PaineWebber commercial created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Company features Mary Farrell one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists sounding particularly bullish
Taped just as the market closed yesterday it offers Ms. Farrell advising We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle
We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long term appreciation
The spot was scheduled to appear three times on C. N. N. last night
PaineWebber considered an even harder sell recommending specific stocks
Instead it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market
We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything which just drives the prices down further says John Lampe PaineWebber 's director of advertising
If you owned it and liked it Friday the true value has n't changed
He adds This is n't nineteen eighty seven revisited
With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than eighty eight points yesterday investment firms had to constantly revise their approach
At Shearson Lehman executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend then had to regroup yesterday afternoon
The plan had been to make one of Shearson 's easy to film black and white Where We Stand commercials which have been running occasionally in response to news events since nineteen eighty five
The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign Leadership by Example
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock market ad
We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said
The market seems to be straightening out we 're taking a wait and see attitude says Cathleen B. Stewart executive vice president of marketing
In any case the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of nineteen eighty seven
But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective
In nineteen eighty seven despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms individuals ran from the market en masse
Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around

You know what the law of averages is do n't you
Baseball that game of the long haul is the quintessential sport of the mean and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend
Morever much of the damage was accomplished by A 's who had some catching up to do
In game two on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn a lot of the catching up was done by the A 's catcher Terry Steinbach
He hit a two zero pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from two one to a decisive five one where it stayed
So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in one hundred thirty regular season games and batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup
If you get your pitch and take a good swing anything can happen he later remarked
On Saturday night quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and no doubt future droughts
Mark McGwire the big red haired Oakland first baseman had three hits in four at bats two more than he 'd had in the five game Dodger series in which he 'd gone one for seventeen
The A. men batting Numbers six through nine a. k. a. the bottom of the order got seven of their team 's eleven hits and scored four of its runs in a five zero decision
Right hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger
The same goes for Mike Moore another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest
Every guy they put out there had a better split finger than the guy before marveled Giant manager Roger Craig
He 's an ex hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat
The upshot of the downshoot is that the A 's go into San Francisco 's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best of seven fest
The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs twenty nine of thirty nine that took two zero Series leads went on to win it all
That 's not an average to soothe Giant rooters
A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams
I 'm for the Giants today but only because they lost yesterday
I love 'em both
The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games said David Williams a Sacramento septuagenarian at the Coliseum before Sunday 's go
The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility
I choose to believe it 's the latter although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here including the A 's and Giants is originally from somewhere else
Anyway the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for
In the opening game besides Steinbach and Stewart there was Walt Weiss a twiggy looking second year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery
He was flawless afield ditto in game two moved a runner along in the A 's three run second inning and homered for his team 's final tally
Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph
Not his autograph power hitter McGwire 's
An A 's co hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson who exemplifies the hot side of the hot cold equation
When you 're in the groove you see every ball tremendously he lectured
The cold guys in the set were Will Clark Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams the Giants ' three four five hitters
They combined for twenty five hits six home runs and twenty four runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs
They went a collective five for twenty four here with zero homers and ribbies
It 's that last set of numbers as much as anything else that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come
I believe in the law of averages declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two
I 'd rather see a so so hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who 's cold
But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side
When it goes you never know when you 'll get it back he said
That 's baseball
N. C. R. Corporation reported a ten percent drop in third quarter net income citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip
Net income for the quarter fell to ninety three point one million dollars from one hundred three point one million dollars roughly what analysts had expected
But per share profit dropped only two percent to one dollar and twenty three cents a share from one dollar and twenty six cents a share as the company continued its stock buy back plan
Average shares outstanding dropped to seventy five point eight million from eighty two point one million
Revenue fell one percent to one point three nine billion dollars from one point four one billion dollars
N. C. R. said revenue declined both in the U. S. and overseas reflecting a world wide softening of the computer markets
The company however said orders in the U. S. showed good gains during the latest quarter
Analysts estimate those gains at twelve percent to thirteen percent a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of N. C. R. 's major customers
These factors combined with a strong dollar should negatively affect the current quarter 's results N. C. R. said
In the year earlier fourth quarter N. C. R. had profit of one hundred forty nine point six million dollars or one dollar and eighty five cents a share on revenue of one point eight billion dollars
Mr. Hingorani said he lowered his full year estimates for nineteen eighty nine to five dollars and thirty five cents a share from five dollars and fifty cents a share
Revenue projections were slashed to six point oh three billion dollars from six point two zero billion dollars
Last year N. C. R. had net income of four hundred thirty nine point three million dollars or five dollars and thirty three cents a share on five point nine nine billion dollars in revenue
Revenues declined one percent to four point one seven billion dollars from four point one nine billion dollars
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday N. C. R. shares fell seventy five cents to close at fifty seven dollars
Concerning your September nineteenth article Wall Street Firms Link Analysts ' Pay to Performance I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard cold facts of the real working world
If the firms are serious however why limit the practice to the poor maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best
Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year
That should stop a lot of account churning and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern careful thought and good sense
Now would n't that be a novelty

Steve Clark a Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated trader reported for work at five a. m. two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting
At Jefferies & Company J. Francis Palamara did n't reach the office until five thirty a. m. but then he had been up most of the night at home
I had calls all night long from the States he said
I was woken up every hour one thirty two thirty three thirty four thirty
People are looking for possible opportunities to buy but nobody wants to stick their chin out
For many of London 's securities traders it was a day that started nervously in the small hours
By lunchtime the selling was at near panic fever
But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street inspired rally the City breathed a sigh of relief
So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London 's financial district
In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge last Friday the London market was considered especially vulnerable
And before the opening of trading here yesterday all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be
By the time trading officially got under way at nine a. m. the news from Asia was in
And it left mixed signals for London
Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less than alarming one point eight percent on thin volume Hong Kong stocks declined six point five percent in orderly trading
At Jefferies ' trading room on Finsbury Circus a stately circle at the edge of the financial district desktop computer screens displayed the London market 's major barometer the Financial Times Stock Exchange one hundred Share Index
Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks blue figures rising stocks
Right away the reds outnumbered the blues eighty to twenty as the index opened at two thousand seventy six point eight off one hundred fifty seven point one points or seven percent
I see concern but I do n't see any panic said Mr. Palamara a big good humored New York native who runs the fifteen trader office
The Jefferies office a branch of the Los Angeles based firm played it conservatively seeking to avoid risk
This is not the sort of market to have a big position in said David Smith who heads trading in all non U. S. stocks
We tend to run a very tight book
Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers and there were n't many buyers
All the takeover stocks Scottish & Newcastle B. A. T. D. R. G. are getting pretty well pasted this morning Mr. Smith said
Seconds later a seven thousand five hundred share sell order for Scottish & Newcastle came in
For the third time in fifteen minutes a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no smoking area to have a cigarette
On the screens only two forlorn blue figures remained but the index had recovered a few points and was off about one hundred forty
Because Tokyo did n't collapse let 's pick up a little stock Mr. Smith said
He targeted seven thousand five hundred shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes
The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at eight hundred forty five pence thirteen dollars and twenty seven cents and Mr. Smith 's traders started putting out feelers
But the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling and the quotes immediately jumped to eight hundred fifty pence
When I want to buy they run from you they keep changing their prices Mr. Smith said
It 's very frustrating
He temporarily abandoned his search for the Reuters shares
Fundamentally dangerous Mr. Smith said almost in a whisper fundamentally weak fairly vulnerable still extremely dangerously poised
we 're in for a lot of turbulence
He was right
By midday the London market was in full retreat
It 's falling like a stone said Danny Linger a pit trader who was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange
Only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony Corney & Barrow wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby
Conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television
At twelve forty nine p. m. the index hit its low two thousand twenty nine point seven off two hundred four point two points
France opened the limit down off at least ten percent if you could calculate the index which you could n't Mr. Clark the Shearson trader said early in the afternoon
Spain is down ten percent and suspended Sweden 's down eight percent Norway eleven percent
This market has been very badly damaged
As two thirty p. m. Wall Street 's opening time neared Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open
In the center of the trading floor chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened plummeting more than sixty points in the first few minutes
They saw an opportunity created by the sell off
As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar P. L. C. Mr. Streeter and trader Sam Ruiz bought them to resell in the U. K.
Investors here still expect Ford Motor Company or General Motors Corporation to bid for Jaguar
Suddenly after about forty five minutes the U. S. markets rallied
The M. M. I. has gone better shouted one trader at about three fifteen London time as the U. S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout
As Wall Street strengthened the London trading room went wild
Traders shouted as their screens posted an ever narrowing loss on Wall Street
Then nine minutes later Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day
Rally Rally Rally shouted Shearson trader Andy Rosen selling more Jaguar shares
This is panic buying
As the London market rallied some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it
The London index closed at two thousand one hundred sixty three point four its high for the day off seventy point five or about three point three percent
Is n't it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year
Do n't be such a pessimist Mr. Ambassador

The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy outs of major U. S. airlines
The collapsed plan to acquire U. A. L. Corporation parent of United Airlines spurred quick action on the legislation introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday
The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow and a floor vote by next week will be urged
The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for A. M. R. Corporation the parent of American Airlines
In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar D. Minnesota Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for A. M. R. and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal
Elaine Chao deputy transportation secretary also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill in its present form
Representative Oberstar brushed off Mr. Trump 's allegations as an excuse for his own deal failing
He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is wiggle room in the administration 's position
Mr. Oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation
But they cited the U. A. L. and A. M. R. examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation
Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for A. M. R. is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation
It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it said one Senate aide
The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy out
Currently the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit
Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline acquisition process and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry
In general the bill would give the Transportation Department a thirty day review period before fifteen percent or more of the voting stock of a major U. S. air carrier could be acquired
It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition
If more information is needed the secretary would have authority to extend the review period twenty days
All the witnesses both congressmen and industry experts expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe cost effective service
But several committee members disapproved some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the U. A. L. deal and the stock market plunge
One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin off companies
In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Company and striking Machinists union members a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow
It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one said Doug Hammond the mediator who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations
We 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that we have made no expression of expectations a Boeing spokesman said
The Machinists union has rejected a three year contract offer that would have provided a ten percent wage increase over the life of the pact plus some bonuses
Currently average pay for machinists is thirteen dollars and thirty nine cents an hour Boeing said
Now in its thirteenth day the strike has idled about fifty five thousand machinists and has started to delay delivery of some jetliners
With a strike fund of about one hundred million dollars the union had said it was prepared for a long strike
After the third week on strike union members will begin receiving one hundred dollars a week from the fund
Work at Boeing continues with supervisors and other non striking personnel manning the lines
And at the company 's Wichita Kansas plant about two thousand four hundred of the eleven thousand seven hundred machinists still are working Boeing said
Under Kansas right to work laws contracts can not require workers to be union members
Boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant Renton Washington plant
Union officials could n't be reached for comment
D. P. C. Acquisition Partners a hostile suitor for Dataproducts Corporation said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker 's common stock
D. P. C. a group led by the New York investment firm Crescott Incorporated also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust Dataproducts ' board
A D. P. C. spokesman declined to elaborate on the group 's new plan
In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Dataproducts shares jumped sixty two point five cents to close at nine point three seven five dollars
Dataproducts which had been seeking a buyer for several months announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block
The company 's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary
As part of the plan Dataproducts announced a pact to sell sixty three million dollars of its real estate holdings to Trizec Properties Incorporated a unit of Canada 's Trizec Corporation
Jack Davis Dataproducts ' president chairman and chief executive officer said the company is at a loss to understand D. P. C. 's intentions
He called today 's announcement opportunistic and disruptive and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring
Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday 's New York sell off but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another rout
European investors have further reason for optimism today after the U. S. rebound
The Frankfurt Stock Exchange which closed before the New York exchanges opened was the hardest hit of the major European markets with the D. A. X. Index dropping twelve point eight percent
In London prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as nine percent before coming back strong after the New York opening to close down only three point two percent
West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said In my view the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly
There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions but they are n't based on fundamentals
The economy of West Germany and the E. C. European Community is highly stable
Paris which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks also was hard hit
Share prices fell in Milan Amsterdam Zurich Madrid and Stockholm
Prices in Brussels where a computer breakdown disrupted trading also tumbled
Following is a breakdown of major market activity
FRANKFURT
One of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of Europe 's strongest economy
The D. A. X. Index of thirty West German blue chips plunged twelve point eight percent a one day record wiping out the summer 's gains
The index closed at one thousand three hundred eighty five point seven two down two hundred three point five six points
By comparison two years ago on Black Monday the new index would have dropped nine point four percent according to a projection by the exchange
This time however many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly
They all went in the wrong direction said Andreas Insam an investment adviser for the Bank in Liechtenstein 's Frankfurt branch
He said he told clients to buy selected West German blue chips after they fell by about ten percent
After the opening was delayed thirty minutes because of the crush of sell orders Frankfurt 's normal two hour trading session was extended seventy five minutes to handle the heavy volume
The beginning was chaotic said Nigel Longley a broker for Commerzbank A. G.
It took three quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market
Institutional investors and bankers many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets were cautiously optimistic after the mild one point eight percent decline in Tokyo stock prices
Everybody was still confident including most institutional investors
That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors said Norbert Braeuer a senior trader for Hessische Landesbank
Some big institutions including banks began picking up lower priced shares late yesterday but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting
Some of West Germany 's bluest chips took some of the biggest hits
Dresdner Bank last month said it hoped to raise one point two billion marks six hundred forty two point two million dollars by issuing four million shares at three hundred marks each
Yet yesterday 's market cropped Dresdner 's share price by thirty three marks to three hundred nine marks a share leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly
LONDON
Headed toward a record drop at midday the London stock market recouped two thirds of its losses in the wake of New York 's early rally
It was big institutions such as Norwich Union Insurance Group Scottish Amicable Investment Managers and Standard Life Assurance Company that spearheaded the rally
Attracted by low prices and encouraged by New York 's performance they scooped up equities across the board
Volume was nine hundred fifty nine point three million shares more than triple recent levels
PARIS
Late buying gave the Paris Bourse a parachute after its free fall early in the day
The C. A. C. General Index ended down five point four percent at five hundred twenty three point six a drop of twenty nine point six points from Friday
There was a volatility in the market that I have never seen before said Michel Vigier a partner in brokerage firm Cholet Dupont
When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening there was panic buying in Paris
Brokers said that as the news spread that Wall Street was moving up traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in mid conversation ordering buys instead
Trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day
When Wall Street turned however the big boys entered the market looking for bargains
J. P. Morgan & Company swung to a loss in the third quarter while N. C. N. B. Corporation reported net income more than doubled and Security Pacific Corporation net rose ten percent
J. P. Morgan & Co
The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company among a few major U. S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long term portfolios to less developed countries with reserves
The latest quarter 's loss equals nine dollars and ninety two cents a share
In the year earlier quarter Morgan earned two hundred thirty three point six million dollars or one dollar and twenty five cents a share
George M. Salem analyst at Prudential Bache Securities Incorporated called the results mildly disappointing
Excluding the two billion dollars provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid earnings were about sixty five cents a share Mr. Salem said
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Morgan climbed one dollar and fifty cents a share to forty four point one two five dollars
Net interest income sank twenty seven percent in the quarter to two hundred fifty four million dollars from three hundred forty seven million dollars
The interest rate on short term funds which banks borrow to finance longer term loans to customers was sharply higher Morgan said
Morgan received two million dollars of interest payments on its medium and long term Brazilian loans had they been accruing interest net interest income would have been thirty five million dollars higher in the quarter Morgan said
Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non accruing costing the bank ten million dollars of interest income in the third period
Income from sources other than interest climbed twelve percent to four hundred fourteen million dollars reflecting higher corporate finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities
These increases were partly offset by lower trading related income the bank said
Non interest expenses grew sixteen percent to four hundred ninety six million dollars
N. C. N. B. Corporation
N. C. N. B. Corporation 's net income more than doubled in the period largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's Texas operations
The strong performance however contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of N. C. N. B. 's problem loans particularly in the Southeast
Nonperformers totaled two hundred thirty point eight million dollars or one point two seven percent in the year ago third quarter
Included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a thirty three million dollars loan which N. C. N. B. said it expects to be fully repaid with no loss early in the fourth quarter
The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of seventeen percent in N. C. N. B. 's Southeast operations as well as a twenty eight percent growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign
The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze N. C. N. B. 's net interest margin in the Southeast to three point three eight percent from three point eight zero percent a year earlier
In Big Board composite trading yesterday N. C. N. B. jumped three dollars and fifty cents a share to fifty one dollars
Results were released after the market closed

Security Pacific Corporation
The company said the gain resulted mainly from a fifty four million dollars increase in net interest income reflecting a thirty three percent increase in real estate loans mainly residential and a nineteen percent rise in consumer loans
These high yielding loans in effect replaced some low yielding assets such as inter bank loans which were allowed to decrease
As a result Security Pacific 's net interest margin fell only thirteen basis points a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California which have been reporting more sluggish earnings
Security Pacific shares closed at forty four point six two five dollars down thirty seven point five cents in Big Board composite trading

LIN Broadcasting Corporation said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Incorporated to buy LIN and has asked for clarification of the offer
The new offer which seeks fifty point three percent of the cellular and broadcasting concern is for one hundred twenty five dollars a share for twenty two million LIN shares
LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corporation and LIN to merge their cellular telephone businesses
BellSouth has notified LIN that it would shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted
The LIN board said holders may be misled by the provision in the McCaw proposal that guarantees private market value after five years for the remaining shares
McCaw has no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain the LIN board said
The board added that McCaw would be able to control LIN 's operations and could therefore operate LIN in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third party purchaser in five years
In national over the counter trading LIN closed at one hundred four dollars and seventy five cents down two dollars and seventy five cents

U. S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the first dispute settlement panel set up under the U. S. Canadian free trade agreement has ruled that Canada 's restrictions on exports of Pacific salmon and herring violate the accord
Mrs. Hills said the U. S. and Canada have until November thirteenth to resolve the dispute
However in Ottawa Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the dispute settlement panel accepted the legitimacy of Canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries
Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the U. S. and Canadian government views of the panel 's report an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions are illegal
The U. S. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions
Canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in British Columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export
This action was defended by the Canadian government on conservation grounds
Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the dispute settlement panel rejected this Canadian government argument
We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel 's ruling that the landing requirement also must be ended she said
Earlier an international panel set up under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian fish export restrictions violated GATT rules
Mrs. Hills said the U. S. wo n't accept any delays after November thirteenth because U. S. fish processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch
She said the Canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded

What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices
No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling
But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency
After the nineteen eighty seven plunge markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose
The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels
It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic
A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself
But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices
What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds
Options markets stopped trading in many securities
The New York Stock Exchange under its own rules remained open
With nowhere else to go sellers and particularly program traders focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange
As liquidity on that market weakened prices fell sharply
Had the futures and options markets been open additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline most probably would have been less intense
At three thirty after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington the futures exchanges reopened
Futures trading however was halted altogether at three forty five after the futures markets had dropped an additional thirty points which is the daily limit for price declines
At this point the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange
It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange the futures markets and the options markets though physically separate have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively
Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them
It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers
To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility either all markets should be open to trading or none
Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday but they probably would have made for smoother less volatile executions
It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open
Let 's not have one market shut down for thirty minutes when the Dow declines one hundred points and another shut down for an hour after a two hundred fifty point decline
The need for hurried last minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets
The new circuit breakers if they are to be applied at all will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open
The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies
In many ways our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago
The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day
Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers and specialists who I believe should stay despite the urgings of some post crash critics have larger capital positions
Of course specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices
Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders
But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished

A UNIFIED EUROPE poses labor problems and prospects for U. S. firms
The social dimension worker concerns of the European Community 's plan to open its internal borders in nineteen ninety two could set the effort off the rails if not done reasonably says General Electric senior vice president Frank Doyle

CLUBBING A FAN was n't the Baltimore Orioles ' fault
So said a federal judge in a case involving two players for the minor league Bluefield Virginia Orioles a Baltimore farm team
The players were heckled by a patron during a July fourth nineteen eighty eight game with the Martinsville Phillies
Like its parent that year Bluefield was not having a good year the judge said
After the game Bluefield lost nine eight stranding three runners in the ninth he noted trouble began
More taunting in the parking lot the players said led to a fight
The fan said he was punched and kicked by one player and that the other broke his jaw with a baseball bat
The judge dismissed the fan 's suit against the team however ruling the Orioles innocent of negligent hiring and not responsible for a fight that was outside the players ' employment

But they search for ways to limit the damage

Since nineteen eighty four more companies give sales loss aid as many real estate values depreciated the council says

Goodrich wo n't ensure loss coverage but will prevent a catastrophic loss it has given some employees the full purchase price when values fell from concern over dangers posed by a disposal site

Yesterday was in the words of New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan Junior just your reasonably normal four hundred million share up eighty eight points day

The so called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures prices were n't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day
Despite traders ' complaints Mr. Phelan said the links with the Chicago futures market worked as planned in Friday 's rout to provide a cooling off period
Of greater help the Big Board chairman said was the natural circuit breaker of the weekend that provided a breathing period that brought rationality back to the market
