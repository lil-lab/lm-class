Reluctant Advertisers Try Soft Sell Spots
CALL IT un advertising
Pittsburgh consultant David Bear is selling a soft approach to clients who want exposure yet shun pushy ads
His ploy sixty second radio spots that offer helpful hints
The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot
The messages resemble the Business Traveler a daily dose of travel tips developed by Mr. Bear and sponsored by travel agencies in several major cities
New un advertisers include Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates a Butler Pennsylvania architectural firm
Its radio series features such spots as Floodlights Evening Wear for Urban Structures and Building a Place to Park
A harder sell says John Kosar the firm 's president would detract from the profession
Hospitals have signed up to use the messages to promote fundraisers and Equitable Gas Company is considering the format to offer energy tips to consumers
But such spots can be too soft
There 's always a risk of lost messages says John Fitzgerald chairman of Ketchum Advertising U. S. A. which created similar radio spots for Pittsburgh National Bank
It 's a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition
Retailer Sees Pitfalls In Environmental Push
HERE 'S a retailer that 's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products
Big Bear Supermarkets Incorporated a grocery chain based in San Diego plans to display shelf cards and distribute pamphlets recommending products deemed safe for the environment
The choices will be based on research by the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition and will include products like Murphy 's Oil Soap and other noncorrosive cleaners
But the chain is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements
For example it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher detergent and puts Sunlight on its environmentally safe list
That does n't thrill Procter & Gamble Company maker of Cascade dishwasher detergent
A company spokesman questioned the validity of the list noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents
In fact Lever Brothers confirms that its Sunlight brand does contain chlorine bleach even though it is n't listed on the label for the powder version
Thomas G. Dahlen Big Bear 's executive vice president said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems
Our intent is to promote the best alternative he says
And it 's important that we be accurate
But in the end customers ' wishes are what will prevail
Big Bear does n't care for disposable diapers which are n't biodegradable
Yet parents demand them
Says Mr. Dahlen We 'll still be forced to sell items we might not philosophically agree with

The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork barrel politics
Nevertheless lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders N. A. H. B. continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special interest spending
There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending
But the N. A. H. B. was created in nineteen forty three out of an organization that made its name fighting a Roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production
Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition pushing for such initiatives as the balanced budget amendment
Yet on matters close to er home
The HUD budget has dropped by more than seventy percent since nineteen eighty argues Mr. Colton
We 've taken more than our fair share
I would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit
But N. A. H. B. support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch over the years the N. A. H. B. has backed a host of public programs
It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti recession housing measures
Moreover explains one HUD official the N. A. H. B. remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production
The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish list which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than fifteen billion dollars annually
Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well connected developers and lobbyists as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal or congressmen
Indirect subsidies through the F. H. A. for instance are little better
More important housing programs run by HUD the V. A. and FmHA are awash in red ink
The F. H. A. alone lost four point two billion dollars in fiscal nineteen eighty eight the government 's equity in the agency essentially its reserve fund fell to minus two point nine billion dollars
All told the federal government already guarantees more than nine hundred billion dollars of mortgages
In its nicely produced publication Where Will Our Children Live the N. A. H. B. does acknowledge that of course the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal government
It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation particularly zoning and building fees which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle income people
The association a majority of whose one hundred fifty six thousand members build fewer than twenty five units a year is like many other business lobbies
Explains Sheila MacDonald of the National Taxpayers Union It treads in two worlds
The builders like the subsidies but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues such as the balanced budget amendment
Unfortunately the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility
Two years ago when the N. A. H. B. lobbied for the nineteen billion dollars omnibus housing bill the organization basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition says Ms. MacDonald
As Mr. Colton of the N. A. H. B. acknowledges Government is not going to solve the problem
The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down
More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies
Is this what the home builders want

The only strong opposition to changing the E. C. treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who is opposed to creating a single E. C. currency
But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity
Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself but could be viewed as an important psychological push
French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the E. C. summit in Madrid last June but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Diplomatic sources said Mr. Kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that West Germany is still committed to E. C. unity
The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke T. Boone Pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade
When asked What went wrong the unfortunate victim replied It was a combination of things
And so it was on Gray Friday
The grand marshal of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage
Even if that is so however it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been erected to stop the procession before the end of the rout e
The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word spread that the U. A. L. buy out was collapsing
Lots of other entries made up the parade of course notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices signalling Federal Reserve tightness and the Bush administration 's temporary defeat in trying to lower the capital gains tax
As usual few favorable reviews were heard for that ever present marching band of program traders although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write
What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street however was the sudden concern that whatever the reason the pool of debt capital is drying up
Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers rather than the small investor as their highly margined investments in the deal stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing
Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses
U. A. L. which triggered the slide opened Monday at two hundred twenty four dollars down about twenty percent from Thursday 's close
A. M. R. opened Monday at eighty dollars down nearly twenty percent from Thursday 's close
Both took further hits yesterday
Hilton lost twenty percent on Friday Paramount lost almost eleven percent
A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured the target 's stock price was not affected on Friday
The multibillion dollar prospects where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and or issue billions in high yield debt were where the damage was concentrated
The market for so called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks
The growing financial difficulties of recent high leverage restructurings or takeovers such as Resorts International Integrated Resources and Campeau 's retailing empire have cast a pall over the entire market for high yield securities
Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk bond sale and restructuring
As a result high yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell eleven billion dollars in junk bonds before year end are experiencing anxious times
These are all market excesses putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity and what we 've seen is the market reining them in
If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday what are the implications for policy makers
After all the stock market 's response to the collapse of the U. A. L. deal might be taken to confirm the anti debt direction of regulators
Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington 's bashing of Wall Street
Absolutely not
The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various L. B. O. deals and leveraged restructurings
The recent difficulties in the junk bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate
Yes the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral but they rode the tiger up all year
Not surprisingly he sometimes bites
The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on Gray Friday while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily
If you identify with the besieged managers you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington
If you side with the arbitragers and raiders you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated
The truth is Washington understands politics better than economics
Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington 's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm
Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs Panama and the deficit all of them parades that seem never to end

Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning with the Nikkei index of two hundred twenty five selected stocks rising six hundred eighteen point six nine points to close the morning session at thirty five thousand eighty seven point three eight
The index slid six hundred forty seven point three three points or one point eight percent on Monday
In the first twenty five minutes of Tuesday 's trading the Nikkei index soared six hundred sixty four point eight three points to thirty five thousand one hundred thirty three point eight three
By ten a. m. Tokyo time the index was up four hundred thirty five point one one points to thirty four thousand nine hundred three point eight zero as investors hailed New York 's overnight rally
Monday 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets
Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe particularly in Frankfurt although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York
Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash
All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since Friday 's one hundred ninety point five eight point plunge on Wall Street
But rather than set the tone for other markets Japan 's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines
Still despite the sudden reappearance of stock market turbulence managers of Japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload U. S. or European equities
We did n't trade much today as our policy now is to wait and see said a fund manager at Taisho Life Insurance Co
We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York
The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary and there was considerable speculation during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that
But in the absence of panicky trading its presence was never overtly felt
At the close the Nikkei average of two hundred twenty five stocks stood at thirty four thousand four hundred sixty eight point six nine down six hundred forty seven point three three points or one point eight percent
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank forty five point six six or one point seven percent to two thousand six hundred point eight eight
The day 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions
Declining issues swamped advancers nine hundred forty one one hundred five
But volume was thin at five hundred twenty six point two million shares compared with five hundred seventy four point seven million Friday
The market opened sharply lower with the Nikkei average down nearly six hundred after twenty minutes
A midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about two hundred at the end of the morning session but the rally failed in the afternoon and the market closed near the day 's low
The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year
The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell one hundred point nine six or two point seven percent to three thousand six hundred fifty five point four zero
Many investors trying to outperform the market 's major indexes have flocked to these small issues in recent weeks
Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market did n't fall more sharply
But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago during the October nineteen eighty seven global stock market crash
On October sixteenth nineteen eighty seven the Friday before the Black Monday crash the New York market dropped four point six percent and Tokyo followed on Monday with a two point four percent drop
This time Wall Street 's plunge of six point nine percent Friday was followed by yesterday 's one point eight percent loss in Tokyo
Two years ago Tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after New York 's twenty two point six percent Black Monday plunge when the Nikkei average fell fourteen point nine percent
Thus market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street 's opening
Nobuto Yasuda a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Company called yesterday 's session a good scenario for Japan
Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders he said
For us institutional investors the chance for buying has come
Isao Ushikubo general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Company also was optimistic
He described Friday 's plunge in the U. S. as a fleeting event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity
Unless there is a panic this is the best time to buy as was the case two years ago he said
Those shares which had posted gains on M. & A. speculation were dashed with cold water but as far as major stocks are concerned there is n't much impact
Other fund managers were similarly sanguine
We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities said Masato Murakami chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co
He said Friday 's Wall Street decline was well within the range of volatility that Yasuda Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy
Among other Asian and Pacific markets Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling eleven point five percent and Singapore 's Straits Times Industrial Index down ten percent
Major indexes declined more than eight percent in Australia and New Zealand and six point five percent in Hong Kong
Bangkok Manila Seoul Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses
Brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to Friday 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy outs and a deteriorating junk bond market
It 's pure psychology said William Au Yeung an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert H. K. Limited in Hong Kong
Markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy outs and their economies generally are in good shape but there 's no doubt that Asia is still following America 's lead
Several analysts said Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows
Hong Kong is the region 's next most open market but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China
Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out they tend to go where the liquidity is said Elizabeth Hambrecht a regional analyst with Baring Securities Hong Kong Ltd
She pointed out that even after Monday 's ten percent decline the Straits Times index is up twenty four percent this year so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably
Similarly Kuala Lumpur 's composite index yesterday ended twenty seven point five percent above its nineteen eighty eight close
In Hong Kong the Hang Seng Index fell one hundred eighty point six zero to finish at two thousand six hundred one point seven zero
Trading was heavy at about one billion shares compared with four hundred seventy three point nine million Friday
But the session was orderly in contrast to the market 's four day closure after the nineteen eighty seven crash
Richard Chenevix Trench a director at Hong Kong based Baring International Fund Managers Limited said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close
If New York does n't collapse I see maybe another five percent on the downside not counting the risk of bad news out of China he said
In Australia Sydney 's All Ordinaries index closed at one thousand six hundred one point five down eight point one percent its biggest drop since October nineteen eighty seven
But volume rose only to one hundred sixty two million shares from one hundred forty three million Friday
London 's Financial Times Stock Exchange one hundred share index the most closely watched market barometer ended at its intraday high of two thousand one hundred sixty three point four down seventy point five or three point two percent
At its low shortly before Wall Street opened it was off more than one hundred thirty points
The Financial Times thirty share index closed seventy nine point three points lower at one thousand seven hundred thirty eight point seven
Volume more than doubled to nine hundred fifty nine point three million shares from four hundred fifty seven point seven million Friday
Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading
The decline in the German Stock Index of two hundred three point five six points or twelve point eight percent to one thousand three hundred eighty five point seven two was the Frankfurt market 's steepest fall ever
Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale pushing some blue chip shares down as much as twenty percent
Analysts cited memories of two years ago when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued to decline steeply for the next three months

Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side everything loose would end up in California
We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's vitality but maybe the state 's la la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place
What else is one to make of the whacky save the earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general
The initiative is based largely on the wish lists of the green lobby the Sierra Club the League of Conservation Voters the Natural Resources Defense Council the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment
Interestingly the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one
Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed
The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards
Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market
In other words California is presuming to take control of the nation 's farm policy
As usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality
Consider the greenhouse effect provision
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of forty percent
Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem
But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative what is going on
The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit
The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp
He 's running for governor
Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on November sixth nineteen ninety
That 's also the day of the gubernatorial election
The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who donate money
And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative on which there are no limits is gravy
This initiative is being labeled The Big Green but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback
The Republican candidate Senator Pete Wilson is playing the initiative fundraising game too sponsoring his own crime initiative
While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through
This is the state that recently passed the Proposition sixty five anti toxic initiative
If this new proposal ever does become law the green lobby will benefit directly
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like
That means the N. R. D. C. and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation taxpayers would bear the cost
Of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves
George Bush for example may decide that he does n't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California
This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the future either as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality or as one being led to wherever its la la activists want to take it
First there was a death watch
Then exhilaration
While the advance cheered investors who feared a nineteen eighty seven style crash would occur yesterday it was strictly a big stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain hunting institutions and program traders
The Nasdaq O. T. C. index closed down six point three one to four hundred sixty point nine eight
Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks U. A. L. and A. M. R. which each fell more than twenty percent when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon
Overall this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective said Arthur Cashin Junior a veteran PaineWebber Incorporated trader at the Big Board
Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the O. T. C. market to get into plus territory
It 's just a strange feeling
I do n't think anyone left the place whistling Dixie
The rally gave credence at least for now to the pre trading declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Junior that Friday 's market debacle was an abnormal condition and not a disaster
But to traders it looked like disaster on the nine thirty a. m. opening bell
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down one point six four shortly after nine thirty
But most of the thirty blue chip stocks in the average including Eastman Kodak and General Motors could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday 's late afternoon rout
At nine forty five Procter & Gamble one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late opened down two and three quarters to one hundred seventeen
The Dow dropped to a quick twenty seven point loss and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble
More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour as the forty nine Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood
Then to make matters worse computerized sell programs kicked in hammering stocks into steeper losses
There was heavy stock index arbitrage as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets
This was a hangover from Friday when Standard & Poor 's five hundred stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks
The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized
They did n't
The Dow accelerated its slide losing sixty three point five two in the first forty minutes of trading
With program traders seemingly in charge buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall
Then at ten fifteen the Dow suddenly started to rebound and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early morning fall
And this time it was n't just the program traders who were responsible
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily
The program traders were in there too of course
But according to one trader the programmers did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was also a lot of bargain hunting by institutions
Roland M. Machold director of the New Jersey Division of Investment which oversees twenty nine billion dollars in investments said the first thing we did was to double our orders yesterday morning
With the market down like this we 'll probably take another fifty million dollars and put it in the market
Trading in Walt Disney Company particularly caught traders ' eyes
According to Big Board officials Disney had one of the biggest sell order imbalances on Friday it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day
The stock opened late at one hundred fourteen and a half down eight and a half
But then it shot upward seven and a half as Goldman Sachs & Company stepped in and bought traders said
However Disney specialist Robert Fagenson said I would be surprised if Goldman represented four percent of the opening volume
Around Wall Street trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday in contrast to Friday 's gridlock
At Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Incorporated head equity trader Dudley Eppel said I think the opening was constructive
It was orderly
We put some orders together
There was n't a lot of panic selling either domestically or internationally
Not like Friday where they just took the market apart
Still the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory and traders were glum
But in another dramatic burst the Dow tacked on forty two points in five minutes and at ten twenty five the index showed a gain of five point seven four
On the Big Board floor and on trading desks traders yelped their approval
Grinned Griffith Peck a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated 's O. T. C. department I tell you this market acts healthy
Around him scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water to cool them off
Among Big Board specialists the cry was Pull your offers meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares
It was bedlam on the upside said one Big Board specialist
But not everybody was making money
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange the nation 's major options market was heavy after the trading in S. & P. one hundred stock index options was halted Friday
Many market makers in the S. & P. one hundred index options contract had bullish positions Friday and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses
Over the weekend clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning
They were absolutely killed slaughtered said one Chicago based options trader
Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index whose twenty stocks mimic the Dow industrials did n't lead yesterday 's big rally
This time institutions saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away
Then when the market was at a technical level to buy they came in with a vengeance
However according to one analyst the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday
Futures were pulling the stock market higher said Donald Selkin head of stock index futures research at Prudential Bache Securities Incorporated
Although the Big Board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's late afternoon chaos according to traders and brokers who work with them
Specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge
But yesterday even with halts in such major blue chip stocks as Merck we expected the halts and it was n't too bad said Donaldson 's Mr. Eppel who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on Friday
According to a Big Board official while many stocks opened late there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues A. M. R. Merck and Valero Energy
Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index
No sector of the market has been spared during the past two days ' gyrations
Yet from the Dow industrials ' high on October ninth through Friday 's plunge relatively good performances have been turned in by real estate utilities precious metals and life insurance stocks
And yesterday the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues
For example Halliburton jumped three and a quarter to thirty eight Schlumberger rose two and a half to forty three and a quarter and Baker Hughes rose one and one eighth to twenty two
Because of the U. A. L. and A. M. R. tumbles airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday
Philip Morris was the Big Board 's most active issue rising two and a quarter to forty three and a quarter on nearly eight million shares
Shares of International Business Machines which reported earnings yesterday finished at one hundred three up one after slipping below one hundred during Friday 's session for the first time in five years
Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings
Merrill Lynch added one and three quarters to twenty eight PaineWebber rose three quarters to eighteen and a half and Bear Stearns rose three eighths to fourteen and a quarter
Federal National Mortgage Association a recently hot stock climbed four to one hundred twenty four on nearly one point six million shares
At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel
Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer driven strategies in recent months
Some twenty four million of the more than one hundred million shares traded in the final ninety minutes of Friday 's session when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated were program related he said
Program trades make up ten percent of the exchange 's volume on an average day but despite the increase Friday it was certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline Mr. Phelan said
Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday
Obviously every time we get this kind of reaction it 's going to make everybody nervous including me he said
He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that all the participants behaved very very responsibly today
Meanwhile Peter DaPuzzo Shearson 's head of retail equity trading praised institutional investors in the O. T. C. market who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors
The institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview
It was the opposite of what happened on October nineteenth
They used their judgment
They did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning
Instead they bought on weakness and sold into the strength which kept the market orderly
Maybe they learned from experience
They did an excellent job Mr. Phelan said of the specialists
Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading suspensions

A House Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental U. S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii
The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less
The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a face saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years
By a six four margin House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights
But the six hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions
As a practical matter flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit but the language would exempt longer routes beginning for example in Chicago or on the East Coast
Within the Senate the ban has had aggressive support from Senator Frank Lautenberg D. N. J. who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative
From the outset the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow
But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states such as North Carolina
Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban
Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest the underlying bill was the subject of behind the scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane but politically important projects of members
In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor

Leery of the costs and critics say competition the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver
Texas Air Corporation which owns Continental and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying
The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for fifty percent of the gates
But this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase expected to cost about two billion dollars
Though smaller in total dollars the conference agreed to preserve an estimated thirty point six million dollars in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports
The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program but the list of qualified airports would be cut by twenty two under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy

Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package
Last month the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature the Sejm in democratic procedures
Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort the first gift of democracy
The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse
Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles they 'd be willing to come back and do the same for the American people

The sudden flight to quality that triggered Friday 's explosive bond market rally was reversed yesterday in a flight from quality rout
The setback in which Treasury bond prices plummeted reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit taking
It was a pretty wild day
Our markets were closely tied to the stock market said Joel Kazis manager of trading at Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co
Friday 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs he said
Some fixed income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly two hundred point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday
That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high quality Treasury bonds which are safer than other types of securities

Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios

Some traders said the high yield market was helped by active institutional buying
In particular they said firms such as First Boston Corporation and Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels
I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds said John Lonski an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Incorporated
U. S. Treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in Japan which opened at about seven thirty p. m. E. D. T.
The benchmark thirty year bond for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick six hundred point drop in the Tokyo stock market
But as Japanese stocks rebounded Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher
Many U. S. trading operations wanting to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U. S. trading would begin were fully staffed during the Tokyo trading session
Most of the action was during the night session said Michael Moore trading manager at Continental Bank
Jay Goldinger who often trades overnight for Capital Insight Incorporated Beverly Hills California said trading in Tokyo was very active but highly volatile
We went down three quarters point in ten minutes right before lunch then after lunch we went up three quarters point in twelve minutes he said
In Tokyo trading is halted during lunchtime
Tokyo 's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for U. S. trading

What does n't belong here
A. manual typewriters B. black and white snapshots C. radio adventure shows
If you guessed black and white snapshots you 're right
After years of fading into the background two tone photography is coming back
Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black and white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans shoes and liquor
Portrait studios accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black and white portrait orders
And black and white photography classes are crowded with students
What 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion home furnishings and cinematography
On Seventh Avenue designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white
And classic black and white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes spurred in part by the backlash against colorization of old films
The pendulum is swinging back to black and white says Richard DeMoulin the general manager of Eastman Kodak Company 's professional photography division
Until two years ago sales of black and white film had been declining steadily since the nineteen sixties
But last year buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications sales increased five percent and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year
Photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market reviving some black and white product lines and developing new ones
The Rochester N. Y. photographic giant recently began marketing T. Max three thousand two hundred one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films
Aimed at commercial photographers the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality says Donald Franz of Photofinishing Newsletter
Also trying to snare a portion of the two billion a year dollars industry is Agfa Corporation a unit of Bayer A. G.
Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith Joyner to endorse a new line of black and white paper that 's geared to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak 's papers
Slated for market by the end of the year the paper could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then says an Agfa spokesman
The biggest beneficiary of the black and white revival is likely to be International Paper Company 's Ilford division known in the industry for its premium products
Sales of Ilford 's four varieties of black and white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market although the company wo n't say by exactly how much
We hope the trend lasts says Laurie DiCara Ilford 's marketing communications director
Why all the interest
For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color black and white seems eye catching and exotic
It has an archival almost nostalgic quality to it says Owen B. Butler the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology
You can shift out of reality with black and white he adds
Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising
Processing of black and white commercial film jumped twenty four percent last year to eighteen point seven million rolls
Consider Gap Incorporated whose latest ad campaign features black and white shots of Hollywood stars artists and other well known personalities modeling the retailer 's jeans and T. shirts
Richard Crisman the account manager for the campaign says Gap did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors
We wanted to highlight the individual not the environment he says and black and white allows you to do that better than color
The campaign won a Cleo award as this year 's best ad by a specialty retailer
Even food products and automobiles which have long depended on color are making the switch
Companies feel black and white will convey a stronger statement says Marc L. Hauser a Chicago photographer who is working on a black and white print ad for Stouffer Food Corporation 's Lean Cuisine
Other companies that are currently using two tone ads include American Express Company and Epson America Incorporated
Portrait studios have also latched onto the trend
Using black and white we can make housewives look like stars says John Perrin
His On Broadway Photography studio in Portland Oregon doubled its business last year and he says is booked solid for the next five
One customer Dayna Brunsdon says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because it 's more dramatic
I show it to my friends and they all say wow
It is n't ordinary like color
Still most consumers are n't plunking black and white film into their cameras to take family snapshots
One big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore
Typically it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned
Black and white film costs consumers a little less than color film and processing costs the same
But for photofinishers developing costs for black and white film are higher
Some companies are starting to tackle that problem
Ilford for example recently introduced a black and white film that can be processed quickly by color labs
Intent on wooing customers the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black and white photography classes
Similarly Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges offering free black and white film and paper as prizes
And Kodak is distributing an instructional video to processors on how to develop its monochrome film more efficiently
Other companies are introducing related products
Charles Beseler Company a leading maker of photographic enlargers introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at teen agers who want to process their own black and white photographs
The kit which has a suggested retail price of two hundred fifty dollars and has already become a bestseller was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children 's photography equipment
It seems computers as hobbies have waned says Ian Brightman Beseler 's chairman and chief executive officer
But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad
They cite the emergence of still electronic photography more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints
Black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute
The color print today is far superior to prints of ten years ago
You ca n't say the same with black and white
But when Popular Photography a leading magazine for photographers selected fifteen of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's one hundred fiftieth anniversary all were black and white

The latest reading of two hundred twenty three point oh was up from two hundred twenty two point three in July and two hundred fifteen point three as recently as March
The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator which uses the nineteen sixty seven average as a base of one hundred
In contrast the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators while up in August has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year
Its ragged behavior through much of nineteen eighty nine has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end
But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely says Geoffrey H. Moore the director of the Columbia facility
A leading authority on the business cycle Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end
The group normally convenes only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely
No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks Mr. Moore reports
Based largely on the recent strength in their index called the long leading indicator the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well
They expect a two point six percent rise in nineteen ninety in the gross national product after adjustment for inflation
Underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries as the case may be by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators
Over the full post World War Two era the Columbia index on the average has entered sustained declines fourteen months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries
The comparable lead times for the Commerce index whose components include the stock market are far shorter ten months before recessions and only three months before recoveries
The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved had it existed in nineteen twenty nine before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression
The indicator reached a peak in January nineteen twenty nine and then fell steadily up to and through the crash
It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now Mr. Moore says
A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond price index which is not a part of the Commerce index
In August the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early nineteen eighty seven
It also rose last Friday while the stock market sagged
Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries the M. two version of the money supply adjusted for inflation and the volume of new home building permits
It was assigned a mark of eighty out of a possible one hundred compared with scores ranging as low as sixty nine for the other components
The stock market has lost some precursory power analysts at the Columbia center claim because of the growing impact of international developments
Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy Mr. Moore says citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets the foreign trade balance and inflows of foreign capital
He also feels that the rise of such computer based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook
B. S. N. S. A. a leading French food group said it agreed to acquire Birkel G.m.b H. a West German pasta maker
The value of the acquisition was n't disclosed
The move is in line with B. S. N. 's strategy of gradually building its share of the European pasta market through external growth
B. S. N. will initially acquire a fifteen percent interest in Birkel a closely held concern
The French group has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding and this could be completed within a few months a B. S. N. spokeswoman said
The takeover was submitted for approval by the West German cartel office B. S. N. said
Birkel is West Germany 's second biggest producer of pasta with sales of two hundred fifty million marks one hundred thirty three point four million dollars in nineteen eighty eight

The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long term deposits to B. three from Ba three and for preferred stock to Ca from Caa

An American journalist now is standing trial in Namibia
This is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it 's going to hold an election
The most likely winner will be the Marxist dominated SWAPO rebels
The U. S. journalist 's crime was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election 's fairness Bryan O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO
Shortly after that Mr. O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested and his passport confiscated
The Stanley affair does n't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts running the government
SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U. N. General Assembly declared it the sole authentic representative of Namibia 's people in
Last year the U. S. brokered a peace settlement to remove Cuba 's Afrika Korps from Angola and hold free and fair elections that would end South Africa 's control of Namibia
The elections are set for November seventh
In July Mr. Stanley editor of American Press International a Washington D. C. based conservative wire service visited Namibia to report on the U. N. monitored election campaign
He interviewed Mr. O'Linn head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation and reported that Mr. O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court
After Mr. Stanley 's article was published in two Namibian newspapers Mr. O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors publisher and lawyer
Mr. Stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to Namibia this month
Both the State Department and the Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press have protested Mr. Stanley 's detention
Mr. Stanley 's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail Namibia 's elections
Both South African and SWAPO extremists are intimidating voters
The U. S. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results
It now has the chance to redress that record in Namibia
State and the human rights community should insist that Mr. Stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the United Nation 's monitors make certain that Mr. O'Linn's commission investigates election complaints from all sides
Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday
Yesterday the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness
Later however it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors
Gold the traditional haven in times of financial crisis continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar rising early in the day as the currency fell and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered
Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy
Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved
Crude oil declined early but as the stock market retained early gains it too became stronger ending with a small net loss
Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines
In Chicago grain and soybean prices rose slightly
Livestock and meat prices however dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork
In commodity markets yesterday PRECIOUS METALS Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently first falling and then later rising
Silver performed quietly
The spot October gold price rose four dollars to three hundred sixty seven dollars and thirty cents an ounce
The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of three dollars and ninety cents an ounce at three hundred seventy one dollars and twenty cents after trading as high as three hundred seventy four dollars
December silver was up two point three cents an ounce at five point one six three dollars
Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy but recovering later as the stock market strengthened
Gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was two years ago on Black Monday
For one thing last Friday precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late in the day nose dive so it could n't react to it
Back on Friday October sixteenth l nine hundred eighty seven the stock market declined during the day and gold prices surged as the stock market fell
Yesterday 's October gain of four dollars was miniscule compared with that
One analyst Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Company New York said the gold market already had some good price supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise with or without the stock market
What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened said Mr. Cardillo
There 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further he said
He expects a drop in interest rates which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising
Finally according to Mr. Cardillo the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit when the figures are released today
This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold he said
ENERGY
Worried that Friday 's one hundred ninety point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices
The U. S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate closed at twenty dollars and fifty nine cents a barrel for November delivery down thirty cents
Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow following several days of significant gains
But most market observers agreed that Friday 's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday
Until yesterday futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand
So any bearish indicator such as Friday 's precipitous drop in the stock market sends shivers through the oil markets as well
Indeed after reacting early in the trading day to Friday 's plummet futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday
COPPER
Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved
The December contract declined three point oh five cents a pound to one point two seven four five dollars
Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use
But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over according to an analyst
Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank
Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle the contracting out of work by the company
Now the analyst said only minor points remain to be cleaned up
For all intents and purposes an agreement appears to have been achieved he said
Copper inventories in New York 's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by five hundred sixteen tons to ten thousand four tons
London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined thirteen thousand five hundred seventy five tons to eighty nine thousand three hundred tons
The L. M. E. stocks decline was about as expected but the Comex gain was n't
However this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market the analyst said
At one point in futures trading as the stock market firmed the December contract rose to as high as one point two nine six five dollars but it was n't able to sustain the gain
It was simply overbought he said and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices
COTTON
Futures prices eased more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market
The December contract ended with a loss of zero point two two cent a pound at seventy four point four eight cents
Technical considerations following the hurricane which was a factor in the market Friday caused prices to decline yesterday said Ernest Simon cotton specialist for Prudential Bache Securities New York
Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana which is part of the Mississippi Delta cotton growing area
However after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane prices began to slip late Friday Mr. Simon said
That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure he said
Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend Mr. Simon said
That has n't yet captured traders ' attention he added
SUGAR
Futures prices declined
The March contract was off zero point three two cent a pound at thirteen point nine seven cents
At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as fourteen point two two cents when the stock market recovered but the price then fell back
A price depressing factor one analyst said was that India which had been expected to buy around two hundred thousand tons of sugar in the world market did n't make any purchases
India recently bought two hundred thousand tons and was expected to buy more the analyst said
Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market
India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar it could buy at lower prices said Judith Ganes analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton New York
At any rate she added India needs the sugar so it will be in sooner or later to buy it
FARM PRODUCTS
The price of the hog contract for October delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of one point five cents a pound
The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering

But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth 's ozone layer and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use or at least emission of the substance
Whirpool said We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of C. F. C. use in appliance manufacture

But because of confusion it took those credits again in reporting its results through the first nine months
Jack W. Forrest Environmental Systems president and chief executive officer said the change increases the company 's effective tax rate to about thirty five percent from twenty percent

Many went bargain hunting
Among those sighing with relief was John H. Gutfreund chairman of Salomon Brothers who took to the firm 's trading floor to monitor yesterday 's events
As the rally gained strength at three fifteen p. m. he smiled broadly brandished his unlit cigar and slapped Stanley Shopkorn his top stock trader on the back
At first it seemed as if history might repeat itself
As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers
By ten ten the Dow Industrials were off sixty three point five two points and the stock of U. A. L. Corporation whose troubles had kicked off Friday 's plunge still had n't opened
But then as quickly as the Dow had fallen it began to turn around
It ended with a gain of eighty eight point one two points
By the market 's close volume on the New York exchange totaled more than four hundred sixteen million the fourth highest on record
The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain in sharp contrast to Black Monday of nineteen eighty seven
But the rally was largely confined to the blue chip stocks which had been hard hit during Friday 's selling frenzy
Overall more Big Board stocks lost money than gained
And many arbitragers already reeling from Friday 's collapse of the U. A. L. deal were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of A. M. R. Corporation the parent of American Airlines collapsed

Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the nineteen eighty seven crash In this age of computerized trading huge corrections or runups in a few hours ' time must be expected
What 's more such short term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling

In Somerset Wisconsin Adrian Sween who owns a supplier of nursing home equipment and is n't active in the stock market agrees
I look at it as a ho hum matter he says
Many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback
The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day
Foreign stock markets which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree began the day off by relatively modest amounts
The dollar after falling sharply in overnight trading to one hundred thirty nine point one zero yen bounced back strongly to one hundred forty one point eight thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U. S. stocks
And the widely disseminated opinion among most market experts that a crash was n't in store also helped calm investors
Many major institutions for example came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on Friday
Still amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday 's events some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday 's
There is too much complacency says money manager Barry Schrager
Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world wide so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe

Unlike two years ago most of Japan 's major investors chose to sit this calamity out

Typical perhaps was Batterymarch 's Dean LeBaron
Mr. LeBaron who manages ten billion dollars says We turned the trading system on and it did whatever it was programmed to do
Asked what stocks the computer bought the money manager says I do n't know
Not everybody was making money

In the fiscal year ended September thirtieth nineteen eighty eight Cluett had operating profit of thirty seven million dollars on sales of seven hundred fifty seven million dollars

Blue Arrow Chairman Mitchell Fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to reincorporating the world 's biggest employment services group in the U. S.
Mr. Fromstein disclosed the planned steps expected within a few months as Blue Arrow posted a two point five percent drop in its third quarter pretax earnings
U. S. holders now own more than sixty percent of Blue Arrow compared with nine percent last January
In the U. S. market the recognition of the Manpower name is infinitely stronger than Blue Arrow Mr. Fromstein said
The moves also could erase shareholders ' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil
It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past said Doug Arthur an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Company in New York
The proposed changes all make a lot of sense to me he added
Mr. Fromstein solidified his control in April by taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman
Blue Arrow was able to pull off the one point three four billion dollars takeover of Manpower in nineteen eighty seven largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies
Under British rules Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the one point one five billion dollars in good will arising from the purchase
As a U. S. based company Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as forty years creating a continuing drag on reported earnings
Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets
But with so many shares now held in the U. S. Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways based on both U. K. and U. S. accounting standards
Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland Mr. Fromstein said
Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow 's U. S. books in one fell swoop but would n't specify how much
People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write down would represent a sizable chunk with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower 's good will
That move along with the return to the Manpower name could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help
The number of U. S. temporary workers fell about one percent in the twelve months ending August thirty first after sliding nearly three point five percent in July said Kidder Peabody 's Mr. Arthur
Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July thirty first partly on slower earnings growth of non Manpower units in Britain
Overall pretax profit slid to eighteen point four nine million pounds in the quarter from eighteen point nine eight million pounds a year earlier
The forty five year old former General Electric Company executive figures it will be easier this time
But analysts while applauding the acquisition say Applied 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in integrating the two companies
Barry Wright acquired by Applied for one hundred forty seven million dollars makes computer room equipment and vibration control systems
The Watertown Massachusetts company 's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped
Last year 's earnings of one point three million dollars including eight hundred fifteen thousand dollars from a restructuring gain were far below the year earlier eight point four million dollars
Besides spurring Barry Wright 's sales which were two hundred one point seven million dollars in nineteen eighty eight Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line
The question is how long it 's going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution says F. John Mirek an analyst at Blunt Ellis Loewi in Milwaukee
The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim
The Butler Wisconsin manufacturer went public at fifteen dollars and seventy five cents a share in August nineteen eighty seven and Mr. Sim 's goal then was a twenty nine per share dollars price by nineteen ninety two
Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule in August nineteen eighty eight
The stock has since softened trading around twenty five dollars a share last week and closing yesterday at twenty three dollars and cents in national over the counter trading
But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of fifty dollars a share by the end of
Reaching that goal says Robert T. Foote Applied 's chief financial officer will require efficient reinvestment of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy nineteen percent rate of return on operating capital
In Barry Wright Mr. Sim sees a situation very similar to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in nineteen eighty five
Applied then a closely held company was stagnating under the management of its controlling family
While profitable it was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital he says
Mr. Sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied
He also professes an evangelical fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision making is shared
Mr. Sim considers the new unit 's operations fundamentally sound and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors
With a little patience these businesses will perform very satisfactorily Mr. Sim says
Within about six months things will be moving in the right direction he predicts
Mr. Sim figures it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat
When he came to Applied I did n't have the power to execute as I do today he says
He was named chief executive officer of Applied in nineteen eighty six and became chairman last November
At Applied Mr. Sim set growth as his first objective
He took the company public in an offering that netted Applied about twelve point six million dollars which helped launch the company 's acquisition program
Sales climbed to an estimated two hundred forty five million dollars in fiscal nineteen eighty nine ended August thirty first from ninety nine point nine million dollars in fiscal nineteen eighty five
No it was n't Black Monday
Some circuit breakers installed after the October nineteen eighty seven crash failed their first test traders say unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures
The forty nine stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the nineteen eighty seven crash once again could n't handle the selling pressure
Big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock traders say
Heavy selling of Standard & Poor 's five hundred stock index futures in Chicago relentlessly beat stocks downward
Seven Big Board stocks U. A. L. A. M. R. BankAmerica Walt Disney Capital Cities A. B. C. Philip Morris and Pacific Telesis Group stopped trading and never resumed
The finger pointing has already begun
The equity market was illiquid
Once again the specialists were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange said Christopher Pedersen senior vice president at Twenty First Securities Corporation
Countered James Maguire chairman of specialists Henderson Brothers Incorporated It is easy to say the specialist is n't doing his job
When the dollar is in a free fall even central banks ca n't stop it
Speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market
Many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early Friday afternoon on a warm autumn day because the stock market was so quiet
Final hour trading accelerated to one hundred eight point one million shares a record for the Big Board
At the end of the day two hundred fifty one point two million shares were traded
The Dow Jones industrials closed at two thousand five hundred sixty nine point two six
The Dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the five hundred eight point Black Monday crash that occurred October nineteenth nineteen eighty seven
In percentage terms however the Dow 's dive was the twelfth worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell one hundred fifty six point eight three or eight percent a week after Black Monday
The Dow fell twenty two point six percent on Black Monday
Wall Street 's takeover stock speculators or risk arbitragers had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and U. A. L. stock would rise
At two forty three p. m. E. D. T. came the sickening news The Big Board was halting trading in U. A. L. pending news
On the exchange floor as soon as U. A. L. stopped trading we braced for a panic said one top floor trader
Several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed
For weeks the market had been nervous about takeovers after Campeau Corporation 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers
And ten minutes after the U. A. L. trading halt came news that the U. A. L. group could n't get financing for its bid
At this point the Dow was down about thirty five points
The market crumbled
Arbitragers could n't dump their U. A. L. stock but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock they had
These stocks eventually reopened
But as panic spread speculators began to sell blue chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses
When trading was halted in Philip Morris the stock was trading at forty one down three and three eighths while I. B. M. closed five and five eighths lower at one hundred two
Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic stop loss orders which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels
Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals including computer guided program traders
Traders said most of their major institutional investors on the other hand sat tight
Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange trading was temporarily halted in Chicago
After the trading halt in the S. & P. five hundred pit in Chicago waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the Big Board and specialists continued to notch prices down
As a result the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart
Without the guidepost of stock index futures the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board
The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders
It screwed things up said one major specialist
This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading stock index arbitrage that closely links the futures and stock markets and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings
In a stock index arbitrage sell program traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference
When the airline information came through it cracked every model we had for the marketplace said a managing director at one of the largest program trading firms
We did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do
But stocks kept falling
The Dow industrials were down fifty five points at three p. m. before the futures trading halt
At three thirty p. m. at the end of the cooling off period the average was down one hundred fourteen point seven six points
Meanwhile during the the S. & P. trading halt S. & P. futures sell orders began piling up while stocks in New York kept falling sharply
Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker worked well mechanically
I just think it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things
He camped out at a high tech nerve center on the floor of the Big Board where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders
At about three thirty p. m. E. D. T. S. & P. futures resumed trading and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line
Buyers stepped in to the futures pit
But the build up of S. & P. futures sell orders weighed on the market and the link with stocks began to fray again
At about three forty five the S. & P. market careened to still another limit of thirty points down and trading was locked again
Futures traders say the S. & P. was signaling that the Dow could fall as much as two hundred points
During this time small investors began ringing their brokers wondering whether another crash had begun
At Prudential Bache Securities Incorporated which is trying to cater to small investors some demoralized brokers thought this would be the final confidence crusher
That 's when George L. Ball chairman of the Prudential Insurance Company of America unit took to the internal intercom system to declare that the plunge was only mechanical
I have a hunch that this particular decline today is something more ado about less
It would be my inclination to advise clients not to sell to look for an opportunity to buy Mr. Ball told the brokers
At Merrill Lynch & Company the nation 's biggest brokerage firm a news release was prepared headlined Merrill Lynch Comments on Market Drop
The release cautioned that there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October nineteen eighty seven and that there are still attractive investment opportunities in the stock market
However Jeffrey B. Lane president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated said that Friday 's plunge is going to set back relations with customers because it reinforces the concern of volatility
And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading
It 's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront
As the Dow average ground to its final one hundred ninety point five eight loss Friday the S. & P. pit stayed locked at its thirty point trading limit
Jeffrey Yass of program trader Susquehanna Investment Group said two thousand S. & P. contracts were for sale on the close the equivalent of three hundred thirty million dollars in stock
But there were no buyers
While Friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning traders said
Stock index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself
At those levels stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall and simultaneously sell off stocks
But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today
The de linkage between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation
The Big Board 's Mr. Grasso said Our systemic performance was good
But the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks
Obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the dealer community obligations were n't met he said
See related story Fed Ready to Inject Big Funds W. S. J. October sixteenth nineteen eighty nine
But specialists complain privately that just as in the nineteen eighty seven crash the upstairs firms big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock stayed on the sidelines during Friday 's blood letting
Mr. Phelan said It will take another day or two to analyze who was buying and selling Friday

Ports of Call Incorporated reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n't disclosed
The agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring
The company said a portion of the thirty two million dollars realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended air charter operations
Earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of Boeing Company 707s because of increasing maintenance costs
A consortium of private investors operating as L. J. H. Funding Company said it has made a four hundred nine million dollars cash bid for most of L. J. Hooker Corporation 's real estate and shopping center holdings
The four hundred nine million dollars bid includes the assumption of an estimated three hundred million dollars in secured liabilities on those properties according to those making the bid
The group is led by Jay Shidler chief executive officer of Shidler Investment Corporation in Honolulu and A. Boyd Simpson chief executive of the Atlanta based Simpson Organization Incorporated
Mr. Shidler 's company specializes in commercial real estate investment and claims to have one billion dollars in assets Mr. Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of L. J. Hooker
The assets are good but they require more money and management than can be provided in L. J. Hooker 's current situation said Mr. Simpson in an interview
Hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell
We want to build and hold
L. J. Hooker based in Atlanta is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter eleven of the U. S. Bankruptcy Code
Its parent company Hooker Corporation of Sydney Australia is currently being managed by a court appointed provisional liquidator
Sanford Sigoloff chief executive of L. J. Hooker said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee
The four hundred nine million dollars bid is estimated by Mr. Simpson as representing seventy five percent of the value of all Hooker real estate holdings in the U. S.
Not included in the bid are Bonwit Teller or B. Altman & Company L. J. Hooker 's department store chains
The Thornton mall opened September nineteenth with a Bigg 's hypermarket as its anchor the Columbia mall is expected to open November fifteenth
The consortium was put together by Hoare Govett the London based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of Security Pacific Corporation
We do n't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid said Allan Campbell the head of mergers and acquisitions at Hoare Govett in an interview
Hoare Govett is acting as the consortium 's investment bankers
L. J. Hooker was a small home building company based in Atlanta in nineteen seventy nine when Mr. Simpson was hired to push it into commercial development
The company grew modestly until nineteen eighty six when a majority position in Hooker Corporation was acquired by Australian developer George Herscu currently Hooker 's chairman
Eventually Mr. Simpson and Mr. Herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company and Mr. Simpson said he resigned in nineteen eighty eight
Since then Hooker Corporation has sold its interest in the Parisian chain back to Parisian 's management and is currently attempting to sell the B. Altman & Company chain
In addition Robert Sakowitz chief executive of the Sakowitz chain is seeking funds to buy out the Hooker interest in his company
The Merksamer chain is currently being offered for sale by First Boston Corporation
Reached in Honolulu Mr. Shidler said that he believes the various Hooker malls can become profitable with new management
These are n't mature assets but they have the potential to be so said Mr. Shidler
Managed properly and with a long term outlook these can become investment grade quality properties

As small investors peppered their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals cash
Unlike the weekend before Black Monday the funds were n't swamped with heavy withdrawal requests
And many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week
At Fidelity Investments the nation 's largest fund company telephone volume was up sharply but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in nineteen eighty seven
The Boston firm said stock fund redemptions were running at less than one third the level two years ago
As of yesterday afternoon the redemptions represented less than fifteen percent of the total cash position of about two billion dollars of Fidelity 's stock funds
Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around said C. Bruce Johnstone who runs Fidelity Investments ' five billion dollars Equity Income Fund
This feels more like a one shot deal
People are n't panicking
The test may come today
Friday 's stock market sell off came too late for many investors to act
Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after Friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices
Stock fund redemptions during the nineteen eighty seven debacle did n't begin to snowball until after the market opened on Black Monday
But fund managers say they 're ready
Many have raised cash levels which act as a buffer against steep market declines
Mario Gabelli for instance holds cash positions well above twenty percent in several of his funds
Windsor Fund 's John Neff and Mutual Series ' Michael Price said they had raised their cash levels to more than twenty percent and thirty percent respectively this year
Even Peter Lynch manager of Fidelity 's twelve point seven billion dollars Magellan Fund the nation 's largest stock fund built up cash to seven percent or eight hundred fifty million dollars
One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in August and September
I 've let the money build up Mr. Lynch said who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes
Not all funds have raised cash levels of course
As a group stock funds held ten point two percent of assets in cash as of August the latest figures available from the Investment Company Institute
That was modestly higher than the eight point eight percent and nine point two percent levels in August and September of nineteen eighty seven
Also persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash
But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around fund managers said
A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday
Stock fund sales have rebounded in recent months but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half nineteen eighty seven levels
There 's not nearly as much froth said John Bogle chairman of Vanguard Group Incorporated a big Valley Forge Pennsylvania fund company
Many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy
Vincent Bajakian manager of the one point eight billion dollars Wellington Fund added to his positions in Bristol Myers Squibb Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday
And today he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like Eli Lilly Pfizer and American Home Products whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines
Fidelity 's Mr. Lynch for his part snapped up Southern Company shares Friday after the stock got hammered
If the market drops further today he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol Myers and Kellogg
If they croak stocks like that he said it presents an opportunity that is the kind of thing you dream about
Major mutual fund groups said phone calls were arriving at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday
But most investors were seeking share prices and other information
Trading volume was only modestly higher than normal
Still fund groups are n't taking any chances
They hope to avoid the jammed phone lines and other snags that infuriated some fund investors in October nineteen eighty seven
Fidelity on Saturday opened its fifty four walk in investor centers across the country
The centers normally are closed through the weekend
In addition East Coast centers will open at seven thirty E. D. T. this morning instead of the normal eight thirty
T. Rowe Price Associates Incorporated increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests
The Baltimore based group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money market funds
But most investors seemed to be in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode said Steven Norwitz a vice president
And Vanguard among other groups said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through
In an unusual move several funds moved to calm investors with recordings on their toll free phone lines
We view Friday 's market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long term investors a recording at Gabelli & Company funds said over the weekend
The Janus Group had a similar recording for investors
Several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize
Some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits
Stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of twenty five percent through September according to Lipper Analytical Services Incorporated
Elaine Garzarelli who runs Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated 's three hundred thirty five million dollars Sector Analysis Portfolio predicts the market will open down at least fifty points on technical factors and some panic selling
But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than ten percent to fifteen percent from recent highs
This is not a major crash she said
Nevertheless Ms. Garzarelli said she was swamped with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders
Half of them are really scared and want to sell she said but I 'm trying to talk them out of it
She added If they all were bullish I 'd really be upset
The backdrop to Friday 's slide was markedly different from that of the October nineteen eighty seven crash fund managers argue
Two years ago unlike today the dollar was weak interest rates were rising and the market was very overvalued they say
From the investors ' standpoint institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson by selling at the lows on Black Monday said Stephen Boesel manager of the five hundred eighty million dollars T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund
This time I do n't think we 'll get a panic reaction
Newport Corporation said it expects to report fiscal first quarter earnings of between fifteen cents and nineteen cents a share somewhat below analysts ' estimates of nineteen cents to twenty three cents
The maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said orders fell below expectations in recent months
Now those routes are n't expected to begin until Jan
Boeing is also supposed to send to America West another seven hundred fifty seven twin engine aircraft as well as a seven hundred thirty seven by year 's end
Those too are almost certain to arrive late
At this point no other America West flights including its new service at San Antonio Texas Newark N. J. and Palmdale California have been affected by the delays in Boeing deliveries
Nevertheless the company 's reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have on other parts of the economy
It also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company
I just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout Tom Baker president of Machinists ' District seven hundred fifty one said in an interview yesterday
I do n't think their customers would like it very much
America West though is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be
I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets they might not miss one at all Mr. Otradovec said
Indeed a random check Friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations
Southwest Airlines has a Boeing seven hundred thirty seven three hundred set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time
It 's so close to completion Boeing 's told us there wo n't be a problem said a Southwest spokesman
A spokesman for A. M. R. Corporation said Boeing has assured American Airlines it will deliver a seven hundred fifty seven on time later this month
American is preparing to take delivery of another seven hundred fifty seven in early December and twenty more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable
In Seattle a Boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike
As of Friday four had been delivered and a fifth plane a seven hundred forty seven four hundred was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to Air China
No date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table
We want to make sure they know what they want before they come back said Doug Hammond the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began
The investment community for one has been anticipating a speedy resolution
Though Boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders
The market has taken two views that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term said Howard Rubel an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Incorporated
Boeing 's shares fell four dollars Friday to close at fifty seven point three seven five dollars in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
But Mr. Baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week
Still he said it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer
I would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything
Last week Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz sent striking workers a letter saying that to my knowledge Boeing 's offer represents the best overall three year contract of any major U. S. industrial firm in recent history
But Mr. Baker called the letter and the company 's offer of a ten percent wage increase over the life of the pact plus bonuses very weak
He added that the company miscalculated the union 's resolve and the workers ' disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime
In separate developments Talks have broken off between Machinists representatives at Lockheed Corporation and the Calabasas California aerospace company
The union is continuing to work through its expired contract however
It had planned a strike vote for next Sunday but that has been pushed back indefinitely
The accord expired yesterday
And Boeing on Friday said it received an order from Martinair Holland for four model seven hundred sixty seven three hundred wide body jetliners valued at a total of about three hundred twenty six million dollars
The planes long range versions of the medium haul twin jet will be delivered with Pratt & Whitney P. W. four thousand sixty engines
Pratt & Whitney is a unit of United Technologies Incorporated
Martinair Holland is based in Amsterdam
A Boeing spokeswoman said a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out for a variety of reasons but not because of the strike

Atco Limited said its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants some valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars eight hundred fifty one million U. S. dollars in Great Britain and elsewhere
The projects are big
They can be one billion C dollars plus Mr. Richardson said
But we would n't go into them alone and Canadian Utilities ' equity stake would be small he said
Ideally we 'd like to be the operator of the project and a modest equity investor
Our long suit is our proven ability to operate power plants he said
Britain 's government plans to raise about twenty billion pounds thirty one point oh five billion dollars from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities beginning next month
The planned electric utility sale scheduled for next year is alone expected to raise thirteen billion pounds making it the world 's largest public offering
Under terms of the plan independent generators would be able to compete for fifteen percent of customers until nineteen ninety four and for another ten percent between nineteen ninety four and nineteen ninety eight
Canadian Utilities had nineteen eighty eight revenue of one point one six billion C dollars mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta where the company serves about eight hundred thousand customers
There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity Mr. Richardson said and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it
This is a real thrust on our utility side he said adding that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries though he would be specific
Canadian Utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain in anticipation of the privatization program
We 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England said Bruce Stram vice president corporate strategy and corporate planning with Enron Corporation Houston a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator
Mr. Stram said Enron is considering building gas fired power plants in the U. K. capable of producing about five hundred megawatts of power at a cost of about three hundred million to four hundred million dollars
P. S. E. Incorporated said it expects to report third earnings of one point three million to one point seven million dollars or fourteen cents to eighteen cents a share
The company said the improvement is related to additional cogeneration facilities that have been put into operation
CONCORDE trans Atlantic flights are two thousand four hundred dollars to Paris and three thousand two hundred dollars to London

Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation said it formed a fifty three point four million dollars limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in California suitable for residential development
Kaufman & Broad a home building company declined to identify the institutional investors
The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development and part of Kaufman & Broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals
There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash
Typically developers option property and then once they get the administrative approvals they buy it said Mr. Karatz adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind
We usually operate in that conservative manner
By setting up the joint venture Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet Mr. Karatz said
The company is putting up only ten percent of the capital although it is responsible for providing management planning and processing services to the joint venture
This is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company Mr. Karatz said
When the price of plastics took off in nineteen eighty seven Quantum Chemical Corporation went along for the ride
The timing of Quantum 's chief executive officer John Hoyt Stookey appeared to be nothing less than inspired because he had just increased Quantum 's reliance on plastics
The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years
Mr. Stookey said of the boom It 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks
But now prices have nose dived and Quantum 's profit is plummeting
The stock having lost nearly a quarter of its value since September first closed at thirty four point three seven five dollars share down one point one two five dollars in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday
To a degree Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so called commodity plastics that pervade modern life
Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history these producers now see their prices eroding
Pricing cycles to be sure are nothing new for plastics producers
And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them
We were all wonderful heroes last year says an executive at one of Quantum 's competitors
Now we 're at the bottom of the heap
At Quantum which is based in New York the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics
Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corporation the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive 's job in nineteen eighty six
Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin used to make garbage bags milk jugs housewares toys and meat packaging among other items
In the U. S. polyethylene market Quantum has claimed the largest share about twenty percent
But its competitors including Dow Chemical Company Union Carbide Corporation and several oil giants have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings
When the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound Quantum 's annual profit fluctuates by about eighty five cents a share provided no other variables are changing
In recent months the price of polyethylene even more than that of other commodity plastics has taken a dive
Benchmark grades which still sold for as much as fifty cents a pound last spring have skidded to between thirty five cents and forty cents
Meanwhile the price of ethylene the chemical building block of polyethylene has n't dropped nearly so fast
That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs
By many accounts an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year
China which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene abruptly halted them
Calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product
Kenneth Mitchell director of Dow 's polyethylene business says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up
People were even hoarding bags he says
Now producers hope prices have hit bottom
They recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks
No one knows however whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to haggle
One doubter is George Krug a chemical industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Company and a bear on plastics stocks
Noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained he remarks Some say October
Some say November
I say nineteen ninety two
He argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity
A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy
The company is trying to carry out a three year one point three billion dollars plant expansion program started this year
Quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its holders because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases
Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation
Some viewed his response that company directors review the dividend regularly as nothing more than the standard line from executives
But others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight from the shoulder performance
In any case on the day of the meeting Quantum 's shares slid two point six two five dollars to thirty six point six two five dollars in Big Board trading
On top of everything else Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in Morris Ill
After an explosion idled the plant in June the company progressed in September to within twelve hours of completing the drawn out process of restarting it
Then a second explosion occurred
Two workers died and six remain in the hospital
This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in Quantum 's fortunes
Until this year the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade group safety awards
A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into Quantum 's financial future
When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand calculating lost profit and thus claims under business interruption insurance is straightforward
But the numbers become trickier and subject to dickering between insured and insurer when demand is shifting
You say you could have sold X percent of this product and Y percent of that recalls Theodore Semegran an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer
And then you still have to negotiate
Quantum hopes the Morris plant where limited production got under way last week will resume full operation by year 's end
The plant usually accounts for twenty percent to twenty five percent of Quantum 's polyethylene production and fifty percent of its ethylene production
Not everything looks grim for Quantum
The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business where market share is often taken through sheer capacity
By lifting ethylene production the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs
Quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals propane marketing
Through a venture with its investment banker First Boston Corporation Quantum completed in August an acquisition of Petrolane Incorporated in a transaction valued at one point one eight billion dollars
Petrolane is the second largest propane distributor in the U. S.
The largest Suburban Propane was already owned by Quantum
Still Quantum has a crisis to get past right now
Some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor
The name surfacing in rumors is British Petroleum Company which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the U. S.
Asked about a bid for Quantum a B. P. spokesman says We pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors and I think that falls in that category
R. J. R. Nabisco Incorporated is disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time just a month after moving eleven of the group 's fourteen employees to New York from Atlanta
The spokesman said R. J. R. is discussing its network buying plans with its two main advertising firms F. C. B. Leber Katz and McCann Erickson
An executive close to the company said R. J. R. is spending about one hundred forty million dollars on network television time this year down from roughly two hundred million dollars last year
The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be disbanded December first and the move wo n't affect R. J. R. 's print radio and spot television buying practices
The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago when R. J. R. 's previous management moved it to Atlanta the company 's headquarters before this summer
One employee with the group said R. J. R. moved eleven employees of the group back to New York in September because there was supposed to be a future
He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies
The R. J. R. spokesman said the company moved the eleven employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' upcoming season
The studies on closing the unit could n't be completed until now he said
The group 's president Peter Chrisanthopoulos was n't in his office Friday afternoon to comment
The U. S. which is finalizing its steel import quotas is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries
Meanwhile the U. S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan 's steel quota and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community
Brazil similar to Mexico and South Korea is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U. S. market than it had under the previous five year steel quotas which expired September thirtieth
Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the U. S. for the year ending October first nineteen ninety
In recent years U. S. steelmakers have supplied about eighty percent of the one hundred million tons of steel used annually by the nation
Of the remaining twenty percent needed the steel quota negotiations allocate about fifteen percent to foreign suppliers with the difference supplied mainly by Canada which is n't included in the quota program
Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the U. S. such as Taiwan Sweden and Argentina also have supplied steel
Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U. S. that are similar to quotas
The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas known as voluntary restraint agreements until March thirty first nineteen ninety two
It also said it would use that two and a half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade which has been notoriously managed subsidized and protected by governments
The U. S. termed its plan a trade liberalization program despite the fact that it is merely an extension
South Korea which had one point nine percent under the previous quotas is set to get a small increase to about one point nine five percent
That increase rises to slightly more than two percent of the U. S. market if a joint Korean U. S. steel project is included
Meanwhile Brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the one point four three percent share it has had in recent years
The E. C. and Japan the U. S. 's largest steel suppliers have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent
The E. C. steel industry which has been coping with strong European demand has been supplying about five percent of the U. S. market compared with recent quotas of about six point seven percent
Japan has been shipping steel to total about four point five percent of the U. S. market compared with a quota of five point nine percent
In the recent talks the E. C. had its quota increased about three hundred thousand tons to seven percent of the U. S. market from six point seven percent in nineteen eighty eight
But its quota has been as high as six point nine percent in nineteen eighty four
Japan however has agreed to cut its quota to about five percent from five point nine percent previously
Japan the E. C. Brazil Mexico and South Korea provide about eighty percent of the steel imported to the U. S. under the quota program
The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters such as Australia and Venezuela
The U. S. had about an extra two percent of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks
That was essentially made up of a one percent increase in the overall quota program and one percent from cutting Japan 's allowance
Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another one percent of the U. S. steel market to allocate
Elcotel Incorporated expects fiscal second quarter earnings to trail nineteen eighty eight results but anticipates that several new products will lead to a much stronger performance in its second half
Elcotel a telecommunications company had net income of two hundred seventy two thousand dollars or five cents a share in its year earlier second quarter ended September thirtieth
Revenue totaled five million dollars
George Pierce chairman and chief executive officer said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under four million dollars
The lower results Mr. Pierce said reflect a twelve month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones Elcotel 's primary business
Although Mr. Pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year he said Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas
Foremost among those is the company 's entrance into the public facsimile business Mr. Pierce said
Within the next year Elcotel expects to place ten thousand fax machines made by Minolta in Japan in hotels municipal buildings drugstores and other public settings around the country
Elcotel will provide a credit card reader for the machines to collect store and forward billing data
Mr. Pierce said Elcotel should realize a minimum of ten dollars of recurring net earnings for each machine each month
Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company 's system for automating and handling credit card calls and collect calls
Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone Mr. Pierce said not just phones produced by Elcotel
The company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones which do n't accept coins for use in hotel lobbies office lobbies hospitality lounges and similar settings
Mr. Pierce estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about five dollars of recurring net earnings for each machine each month
Britain 's retail price index rose zero point seven percent in September from August and was up seven point six percent for the year the Central Statistical Office said
Quest Medical Incorporated said it adopted a shareholders ' rights plan in which rights to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed as a dividend to shareholders of record as of October twenty third
The company said the plan was n't adopted in response to any known offers for Quest a maker and marketer of hospital products
The rights allow shareholders to purchase Quest stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than fifteen percent of the company 's common stock or announces a tender offer
Measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry room
Procter & Gamble Company plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload
The move stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds
It also marks P. & G. 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals such as Kao Corporation may bring their superconcentrates to the U. S.
The Cincinnati consumer products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent called Attack which quickly won a thirty percent stake in the Japanese markets
They do n't want to get caught again says one industry watcher
Retailers in Phoenix Arizona say P. & G. 's new powdered detergent to be called Cheer with Color Guard will be on shelves in that market by early November
A P. & G. spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month
She said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others
Superconcentrates are n't entirely new for P. & G.
The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack
When Attack hit the shelves in nineteen eighty seven P. & G. 's share of the Japanese market fell to about eight percent from more than twenty percent
With the help of Lemon Cheer P. & G. 's share is now estimated to be twelve percent
The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it 's already expanded its best selling Tide into sixteen different varieties including this year 's big hit Tide with Bleach
In the early nineteen eighties P. & G. tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe
But the product which was n't as concentrated as the new Cheer bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped
P. & G. and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches but they have n't sold well despite the convenience
But P. & G. contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading
And retailers are expected to embrace the product in part because it will take up less shelf space
When shelf space was cheap bigger was better says Hugh Zurkuhlen an analyst at Salomon Bros
But with so many brands vying for space that 's no longer the case
If the new Cheer sells well the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates
Then retailers will probably push the less established brands out altogether he says
Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U. S.
To be sure Kao would n't have an easy time taking U. S. market share away from the mighty P. & G. which has about twenty three percent of the market
Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U. S. but so far the company has focused on acquisitions such as last year 's purchase of Andrew Jergens Company a Cincinnati hand lotion maker
It also has a product testing facility in California
Some believe P. & G. 's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese
This is something P. & G. would do with or without Kao says Mr. Zurkuhlen
With economic tension between the U. S. and Japan worsening many Japanese had feared last week 's visit from U. S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U. S.
Instead they got a discussion of the need for the U. S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long term view
Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher
Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade
He said such results should be measurable in dollars and cents in reducing the U. S. trade deficit with Japan
She added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we 're moving in earnest
How such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills
Many called it simply a contrast in styles
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic
Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand
And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade
Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher 's Mrs. Hills replied I did n't hear every word he spoke but as a general proposition I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration
Yet more than one American official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly conciliatory
I think my line has been very consistent Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon
I am painted sometimes as ferocious perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement
I do n't feel very ferocious
I do n't feel either hard or soft
I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade
She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U. S. government has identified
But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world wide free trade and open competition
She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets
At her news conference for Japanese reporters one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief
My impression was that you would be a scary old lady he said drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues
But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity
Mrs. Hills ' remarks did raise questions at least among some U. S. officials about what exactly her stance is on U. S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market
The U. S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around ten percent for years
Many Americans have interpreted a nineteen eighty six agreement as assuring U. S. companies a twenty percent share by nineteen ninety one but the Japanese have denied making any such promise
At one of her news conferences Mrs. Hills said I believe we can do much better than twenty percent
But she stressed I am against managed trade
I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market
Traditional Industries Incorporated said it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that ended June thirtieth and is seeking new financing
The seller of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives including seeking increases in its credit lines
Traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects to show a profit for the year
In the year ended June thirtieth nineteen eighty eight Traditional reported net income of four point nine million dollars or one dollar and twenty one cents a share
The company did n't break out its fourth quarter results
In the latest nine months net income was four point seven million dollars or one dollar and thirty one cents a share on revenue of forty four point three million dollars
Separately the company said it would file a delayed fiscal year report with the Securities and Exchange Commission within approximately forty five days
It said the delay resulted from difficulties in resolving its accounting of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission
Under an agreement filed in federal court in August to settle F. T. C. objections to some Traditional sales practices Traditional said it would establish a two hundred fifty thousand dollars trust fund to provide refunds to certain customers
Information International Incorporated said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized newspaper publishing system alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system
Information International said it believes that the complaints filed in federal court in Georgia are without merit
Closely held Morris Communications is based in Augusta Ga
The units that filed the suit are Southeastern Newspapers Corporation and Florida Publishing Co
Syms Corporation completed the sale of its A. Sulka & Company subsidiary a men 's luxury haberdashery to Luxco Investments
Terms were n't disclosed
As Syms 's core business of off price retailing grows a small subsidiary that is operationally unrelated becomes a difficult distraction said Marcy Syms president of the parent in a statement
A spokeswoman said Sulka operates a total of seven stores in the U. S. and overseas
Syms operates twenty five off price apparel stores in the U. S.
The oil industry 's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability
The gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and analysts say reducing chances that profits could equal their year earlier performance
The industry is seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals Glenn Cox president of Phillips Petroleum Company said in an interview
That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general he added
He did n't forecast Phillips 's results
But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third quarter earnings
So too many analysts predict will Exxon Corporation Chevron Corporation and Amoco Corporation
Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies
It has plunged thirteen percent since July to around twenty six cents a pound
A year ago ethylene sold for thirty three cents peaking at about thirty four cents last December
A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion
Beginning in mid nineteen eighty seven prices began accelerating as a growing U. S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand
Companies added capacity furiously
Now greatly increased supplies are on the market while the dollar is stronger and domestic economic growth is slower
Third quarter profits from gasoline were weaker
Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year said William Randol a securities analyst at First Boston Corporation
Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that did n't materialize
The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period
In addition crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier further pressuring profitability
Refiners say margins picked up in September and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter though still not to the level of nineteen eighty eight 's fourth quarter
During the nineteen eighty eight second half many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits
Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year
Prices averaging roughly two dollars a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies ' expectations
Demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter
We could see higher oil prices this year said Bryan Jacoboski an analyst at PaineWebber Incorporated
That will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below thirteen dollars a barrel in the fourth quarter
While oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse
In the third quarter they averaged about five percent less than they were in nineteen eighty eight
The main reason remains weather
Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use
This summer on the other hand had milder weather than usual
We 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices said Mr. Cox Phillips 's president
The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected
Going into the fourth quarter natural gas prices are anywhere from eight percent to seventeen percent lower than a year earlier
The Bush administration trying to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc is questioning whether Italy 's Ing C. Olivetti & Company supplied militarily valuable technology to the Soviets
They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools computers and other high technology products
But the Bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export control procedures before it will support further liberalization
To make its point it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft
Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in nineteen eighty four
A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U. S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom but declined to confirm any details
Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules
President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader 's visit here last week
Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities
Although the legality of these sales is still an open question the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community
It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U. S. computer companies
The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export control policies reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies
Last summer Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods
But more recently the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc
However these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization
There 's no evidence that the Soviet program to illegally acquire Western technology has diminished said a State Department spokesman
Salomon Brothers International Limited a British subsidiary of Salomon Incorporated announced it will issue warrants on shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd
The move closely follows a similar offer by Salomon of warrants for shares of Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation
The fifty million warrants will be priced at one dollar and twenty five cents each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about twenty six percent
In trading on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong the shares closed Wednesday at four dollars and eighty cents each
At this price the shares would have to rise above six dollars and five cents for subscribers to Salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants
While Hong Kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares Salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party
Salomon will cover the warrants by buying sufficient shares or options to purchase shares to cover its entire position
Bankers said warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk
The Hong Kong Telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in Europe the bankers added because the group is one of a handful of blue chip stocks on the Hong Kong market that has international appeal
In a suit filed in federal court Thursday the S. & L. alleged that a disproportionate number of the bonds it purchased in nineteen eighty four declined in value
Financial Corporation purchased the bonds the suit alleged after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a fifty one percent stake in the thrift for about thirty four million dollars
Vagabond Hotels was controlled by Mr. Boesky who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations
Officials at Drexel said they had n't seen the suit and thus could n't comment
In addition to thirty three million dollars compensatory damages the suit seeks one hundred million dollars in punitive damages
Also named in the suit is Ivan F. Boesky Corporation and Northview Corporation the successor company to Vagabonds Hotels
Northview officials could n't be located
Financial Corporation said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F. Boesky Corporation visited it in November nineteen eighty three and said Financial Corporation could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds
Shortly before the visit Mr. Boesky and Drexel representives had met with Financial Corporation officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the fifty one percent stake in the company
However the agreement was canceled in June nineteen eighty four
Financial Corporation purchased the bonds in at least seventy different transactions in nineteen eighty four and since then has realized eleven million dollars in losses on them the company said
But H. O. F. I. 's first offer would have given Ideal 's other shareholders about ten percent of the combined company
Ideal 's directors rejected that offer although they said they endorsed the merger proposal
Under the agreement H. O. F. I. will own eighty seven point two percent of the combined company
Ideal 's current operations will represent about thirty nine point two percent of the combined company
The transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by Ideal shareholders
Ideal said it expects to complete the transaction early next year
While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought induced peaks of nineteen eighty eight wheat prices remain stubbornly high
And they 're likely to stay that way for months to come analysts say
For one thing even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into nineteen ninety the analysts say
And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat growing areas yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced further squeezing supplies
Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months
By next May thirty first stocks of U. S. wheat to be carried over into the next season before the winter wheat now being planted is harvested are projected to drop to four hundred forty three million bushels
That would be the lowest level since the early nineteen seventies
Stocks were six hundred ninety eight million bushels on May thirty first of this year
In response to dwindling domestic supplies Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month said the U. S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments
The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about sixty six million bushels
It now estimates production for next year at just under two point six billion bushels compared with this year 's estimated two point oh four billion and a drought stunted one point eight one billion in nineteen eighty eight
But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year
Until then limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the four dollars a bushel level analysts say
On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday wheat for December delivery settled at four point oh six seven five dollars a bushel unchanged
In theory at least tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply demand squeeze said Daniel Basse a futures analyst with AgResource Company in Chicago
Such a situation can wreak havoc as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade
In July the C. B. O. T. ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about twenty three million bushels of soybeans
The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate which had refused requests to reduce its holdings
Ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market
For example in the Oklahoma panhandle forty percent or more of the topsoil is short of moisture
That figure climbs to about forty seven percent in wheat growing portions of Kansas he said
The Soviet Union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U. S. wheat in the next few months further supporting prices
Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand in coming weeks predicted Richard Feltes vice president research for Refco Incorporated in Chicago
Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week
Orange Juice Traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began Friday will go
Late Thursday after the close of trading the market received what would normally have been a bullish U. S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the nineteen eighty nine ninety Florida orange crop
It was near the low range of estimates at one hundred thirty million ninety pound boxes compared with one hundred forty six point six million boxes last season
Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U. S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as six point five five cents a pound at one time
It settled with a loss of four point nine five cents at one point three two one zero dollars a pound
Brazilian juice after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season is beginning to arrive in the U. S. in large quantities
Brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product which is going to be in plentiful supply
The price cut one analyst said appeared to be aimed even more at Europe where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen
It 's a dollar priced product and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe the analyst said
New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than two dollars a pound at midyear
Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak the analyst said
Energy
Although some analysts look for profit taking in the wake of Friday 's leap in crude oil prices last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week
I would continue to look for a stable crude market at least in futures trading said William Hinton an energy futures broker with Stotler & Co
Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets
On the New York Mercantile Exchange West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at twenty dollars and eighty nine cents a barrel up forty two cents on the day
On European markets meanwhile spot prices of North Sea crudes were up thirty five to seventy five cents a barrel
This market still wants to go higher said Nauman Barakat a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated
He predicted that the November contract will reach twenty one dollars and fifty cents a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange
There has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets
Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes
There also are recurring reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell
Many traders foresee a tightening of near term supplies particularly of high quality crudes such as those produced in the North Sea and in Nigeria
If a hostile predator emerges for Saatchi & Saatchi Company co founders Charles and Maurice Saatchi will lead a management buy out attempt an official close to the company said
Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday 's stock market sell off in New York and turmoil in the junk bond market
But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks
Last week Saatchi 's largest shareholder Southeastern Asset Management said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring
And Carl Spielvogel chief executive officer of Saatchi 's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit said he had offered to lead a management buy out of the company but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi
Mr. Spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid
But otherwise it would undoubtedly come back with an offer by management
The executive said any buy out would be led by the current board whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi
Mr. Spielvogel is n't part of the board nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi 's big U. S. based ad agencies
The executive did n't name any price but securities analysts have said Saatchi would fetch upward of one point three billion dollars
The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy back
That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive Robert Louis Dreyfus who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on January first
Mr. Louis Dreyfus formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm I. M. S. International Incorporated has a reputation as a savvy financial manager and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi 's poor financial state
Asked about the speculation that Mr. Louis Dreyfus has been hired to pave the way for a buy out by the brothers the executive replied That is n't the reason Dreyfus has been brought in
He was brought in to turn around the company
Separately several Saatchi agency clients said they believe the company 's management shakeup will have little affect on them
It has n't had any impact on us nor do we expect it to said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Company a major client of Backer Spielvogel
John Lampe director of advertising at PaineWebber Incorporated a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client said We have no problem with the announcement because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about
We are n't going to change agencies because of a change in London
Executives at Backer Spielvogel client Avis Incorporated as well as at Saatchi client Philips Lighting Company also said they saw no effect
Executives at Prudential Bache Securities Incorporated a Backer Spielvogel client that is reviewing its account declined comment
Mr. Spielvogel had said that Prudential Bache was prepared to finance either a management buy out and restructuring or a buy out of Backer Spielvogel alone led by him

Citing a payment from a supplier and strong sales of certain data storage products Maxtor Corporation said earnings and revenue jumped in its second quarter ended September twenty fourth
The maker of computer data storage products said net income rose to four point eight million dollars or twenty three cents a share from year earlier net of one point one million dollars or five cents a share
Revenue soared to one hundred seventeen million dollars from eighty one point five million dollars
Maxtor said its results were boosted by two million dollars in payments received from a supplier for a certain line of products that Maxtor is n't going to sell anymore
Maxtor said effects from discontinuing the line may have a positive effect on future earnings and revenue
A spokeswoman would n't elaborate but the company said the discontinued product has never been a major source of revenue or profit
Operationally Maxtor benefited from robust sales of products that store data for high end personal computers and computer workstations
In the fiscal first half net was seven million dollars or thirty four cents a share up from the year earlier three point one million dollars or fifteen cents a share
Revenue rose to two hundred twenty five point five million dollars from one hundred sixty one point eight million dollars

MedChem Products Incorporated said a U. S. District Court in Boston ruled that a challenge by MedChem to the validity of a U. S. patent held by Pharmacia Incorporated was without merit
Pharmacia based in Upsala Sweden had charged in a lawsuit against MedChem that MedChem 's AMVISC product line infringes on the Pharmacia patent
The patent is related to hyaluronic acid a rooster comb extract used in eye surgery
In its lawsuit Pharmacia is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction to block MedChem from selling the AMVISC products
A MedChem spokesman said the products contribute about a third of MedChem 's sales and ten percent to twenty percent of its earnings
In the year ended August thirty first nineteen eighty eight MedChem earned two point nine million dollars or seventy two cents a share on sales of seventeen point four million dollars
MedChem said the court 's ruling was issued as part of a first phase trial in the patent infringement proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case
It said it is considering all of its options in light of the decision including a possible appeal
The medical products company added that it plans to assert its other defenses against Pharmacia 's lawsuit including the claim that it has n't infringed on Pharmacia 's patent
MedChem said that the court scheduled a conference for next Monday to set a date for proceedings on Pharmacia 's motion for a preliminary injunction
Newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third quarter results aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising linage especially in the Northeast
Adding to unsteadiness in the industry seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general hardships within the retail industry
Many papers throughout the country are also faced with a slowdown in classified ad spending a booming category for newspapers in recent years
Until recently industry analysts believed decreases in retail ad spending had bottomed out and would in fact increase in this year 's third and fourth quarters
All bets are off analysts say because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains
Improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad linage they usually run said Edward J. Atorino industry analyst for Salomon Brothers Incorporated
Retailers are just in disarray
For instance Gannett Company posted an eleven percent gain in net income as total ad pages dropped at U. S. A. Today but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates
Gannett 's eighty three daily and thirty five non daily newspapers reported a three percent increase in advertising and circulation revenue
Total advertising linage was modestly lower as classified ad volume increased while there was softer demand for retail and national ad linage said John Curley Gannett 's chief executive officer
At U. S. A. Today ad pages totaled seven hundred eighty five for the quarter down nine point two percent from the nineteen eighty eight period which was helped by increased ad spending from the Summer Olympics
Revenue gained six percent to two point five five billion dollars from two point four billion dollars
At Dow Jones & Company third quarter net income fell nine point nine percent from the year earlier period
Net fell to twenty eight point eight million dollars or twenty nine cents a share from thirty two million dollars or thirty three cents a share
The year earlier period included a one time gain of three point five million dollars or four cents a share
Revenue gained five point three percent to four hundred four point one million dollars from three hundred eighty three point eight million dollars
The drop in profit reflected in part continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine
Ad linage at the Journal fell six point one percent in the third quarter
Affiliated Publications Incorporated reversed a year earlier third quarter net loss
William O. Taylor the parent 's chairman and chief executive officer said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the Boston newspaper
Third quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint which in the last two years has had several price increases
After a supply crunch caused prices to rise fourteen percent since nineteen eighty six to six hundred fifty dollars a metric ton analysts are encouraged because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year
Companies with daily newspapers in the Northeast will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad linage
Mr. Atorino at Salomon Brothers said he estimates that Times Mirror Company 's earnings were down for the third quarter because of soft advertising levels at its Long Island Newsday and Hartford Courant newspapers
Trouble on the East Coast was likely offset by improved ad linage at the Los Angeles Times which this week also unveiled a redesign
New York Times Company is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship New York Times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate Forest Products Group
Times Company 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well but there is little sign that things will improve in the New York market said Alan Kassan an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Washington Post Company is expected to report improved earnings largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the Washington area
According to analysts profits were also helped by successful cost cutting measures at Newsweek
The news weekly has faced heightened competition from rival Time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market
Knight Ridder Incorporated is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its Detroit Free Press and Gannett 's Detroit News and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter
However analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers such as the Miami Herald and San Jose Mercury News
The Miami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years when Knight Ridder was starting up a Hispanic edition and circulation was falling said Bruce Thorp an analyst for Provident National Bank
In announcements to workers late last week G. M. effectively signed death notices for two full sized van assembly plants and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U. S. car factories
G. M. is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's U. S. market share skidded during the past decade
The company currently using about eighty percent of its North American vehicle capacity has vowed it will run at one hundred percent of capacity by nineteen ninety two
Just a month ago G. M. announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood Georgia the eighth U. S. assembly facility to close since nineteen eighty seven
Now G. M. appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the nineteen nineties
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U. S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than G. M. can match
Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year
G. M. officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin
The problem however is that G. M. 's moves are coming at a time when U. A. W. leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of G. M. layoffs
Against that backdrop U. A. W. Vice President Stephen P. Yokich who recently became head of the union 's G. M. department issued a statement Friday blasting G. M. 's flagrant insensitivity toward union members
The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed disarray and an inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information Mr. Yokich said
G. M. officials told workers late last week of the following moves Production of full sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint Mich
That means two plants one in Scarborough Ontario and the other in Lordstown Ohio probably will be shut down after the end of nineteen ninety one
The shutdowns will idle about three thousand Canadian assembly workers and about two thousand five hundred workers in Ohio
Robert White Canadian Auto Workers union president used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U. S. Canada free trade agreement and its champion Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate G. M. move that affects three U. S. car plants and one in Quebec
Workers at plants in Van Nuys California Oklahoma City and Pontiac Michigan were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars
G. M. is studying whether it can build the new Camaro Firebird profitably at a plant in Street Therese Quebec company and union officials said
That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures
The Van Nuys plant which employs about three thousand workers does n't have a product to build after nineteen ninety three
Jerry Shrieves U. A. W. local president said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a flex plant which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand
He said he believes G. M. has plans to keep building A. body cars into the mid nineteen nineties
At Pontiac however the Camaro Firebird decision appears to erase U. A. W. hopes that G. M. would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic bodied two seater Pontiac Fiero model
The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union management cooperation at G. M. before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year
Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result
Dissident U. A. W. members have used the Fiero plant as a symbol of labor management cooperation 's failure
Institut Merieux S. A. of France said the Canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of Connaught BioSciences Incorporated for nine hundred forty two million Canadian dollars eight hundred one point six million U. S. dollars
Merieux said the government 's minister of industry science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of net benefit to Canada
Canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard
The French company said the government gave it thirty days in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan
Both Merieux and Connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns
The government 's action was unusual
He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed
This is n't a change in government policy this provision has been used before said Jodi Redmond press secretary for Harvie Andre Canada 's minister of industry science and technology
Mr. Andre issued the ruling based on a recommendation by Investment Canada
Spokesmen for Merieux and Connaught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or Investment Canada but added they hope to have more information early this week
Investment Canada declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision
Viren Mehta a partner with Mehta & Isaly a New York based pharmaceutical industry research firm said the government 's ruling was n't unexpected
This has become a very politicized deal concerning Canada 's only large world class bio research or pharmaceutical company Mr. Mehta said
Mr. Mehta said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out of court settlement of Connaught 's dispute with the University of Toronto
The University is seeking to block the acquisition of Connaught by foreign interests citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in Canada
The university is considering a settlement proposal made by Connaught
While neither side will disclose its contents Mr. Mehta expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in Canada than Merieux offered to Investment Canada
Some analysts such as Murray Grossner of Toronto based Richardson Greenshields Incorporated believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders such as Switzerland 's Ciba Geigy and Chiron Corporation of Emeryville Calif
Officials for the two concerns which are bidding thirty dollars a share for Connaught could n't be reached for comment
French state owned Rhone Poulenc S. A. holds fifty one percent of Merieux
Weatherford International Incorporated said it canceled plans for a preferred stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock and added that it expects to publicly offer about ten million common shares
The company said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the five hundred eighty five thousand shares of its preferred stock outstanding
The exchange ratio was never established
Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange
The energy services concern said however that in January nineteen ninety it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock
Weatherford suspended its preferred dividend payment in October nineteen eighty five and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about six million dollars but will do so some time in the future
Additionally the company said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of ten million shares of common stock expected to be offered in November
The company said Salomon Brothers Incorporated and Howard Weil Labouisse Friedrichs Incorporated underwriters for the offering were granted an option to buy as much as an additional one point five million shares to cover over allotments
Proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt
Weatherford currently has approximately eleven point one million common shares outstanding
Earnings for most of the nation 's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead briskly in the third quarter as companies with newer big selling prescription drugs fared especially well
For the third consecutive quarter however most of the companies ' revenues were battered by adverse foreign currency translations as a result of the strong dollar abroad
Analysts said that Merck & Company Eli Lilly & Company Warner Lambert Company and the Squibb Corporation unit of Bristol Myers Squibb Company all benefited from strong sales of relatively new higher priced medicines that provide wide profit margins
Less robust earnings at Pfizer Incorporated and Upjohn Company were attributed to those companies ' older products many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines
Joseph Riccardo an analyst with Bear Stearns & Company said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their slow growing businesses and instituted other cost savings such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs
As a result major new products are having significant impact even on a company with very large revenues Mr. Riccardo said
Analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers as a group is estimated to have climbed between eleven percent and fourteen percent
While that 's not spectacular Neil Sweig an analyst with Prudential Bache said that the rate of growth will look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward
Profit climbed even though Merck 's sales were reduced by one to three percentage points as a result of the strong dollar Mr. Sweig said
In the third quarter of nineteen eighty eight Merck earned three hundred eleven point eight million dollars or seventy nine cents a share
In Rahway N. J. a Merck spokesman said the company does n't make earnings projections
Mr. Sweig said he estimated that Lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about twenty percent largely because of the performance of its new anti depressant Prozac
The drug introduced last year is expected to generate sales of about three hundred million dollars this year
It 's turning out to be a real blockbuster Mr. Sweig said
In last year 's third quarter Lilly earned one hundred seventy one point four million dollars or one dollar and twenty cents a share
In Indianapolis Lilly declined comment
The company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins
The company 's lean operation analysts said allowed sharp rising sales from its cholesterol drug Lopid to power earnings growth
Lopid sales are expected to be about three hundred million dollars this year up from one hundred ninety million dollars in nineteen eighty eight
In Morris Plains N. J. a spokesman for the company said the analysts ' projections are in the ballpark
The company was officially merged with Bristol Myers Company earlier this month
Bristol Myers declined to comment
ScheringPlough earned ninety four point four million dollars or eighty four cents a share while Bristol Myers earned two hundred thirty two point three million dollars or eighty one cents a share in the like period a year earlier
In Madison N. J. a spokesman for Schering Plough said the company has no problems with the average estimate by a analysts that third quarter earnings per share rose by about nineteen percent to one dollar
The company expects to achieve the twenty percent increase in full year earnings per share as it projected in the spring the spokesman said
Meanwhile analysts said Pfizer 's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about five percent
Sales of Pfizer 's important drugs Feldene for treating arthritis and Procardia a heart medicine have shrunk because of increased competition
The strong dollar hurt Pfizer a lot too Mr. Sweig said
In the third quarter last year Pfizer earned two hundred sixteen point eight million dollars or one dollar and twenty nine cents a share
In New York the company declined comment
Upjohn 's biggest selling drugs are Xanax a tranquilizer and Halcion a sedative
Sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs
In Kalamazoo Michigan Upjohn declined comment
Amid a crowd of crashing stocks Relational Technology Incorporated 's stock fell particularly hard Friday dropping twenty three percent because its problems were compounded by disclosure of an unexpected loss for its fiscal first quarter
The database software company said it expects a two million dollars net loss for the fiscal first quarter ended September thirtieth
It said analysts had been expecting a small profit for the period
Revenue is expected to be up modestly from the twenty six point five million dollars reported a year ago
Relational Technology reported net income of one point five million dollars or twelve cents a share in the year earlier period
While our international operations showed strong growth our domestic business was substantially below expectations said Paul Newton president and chief executive officer
A spokesman said the company 's first quarter is historically soft and computer companies in general are experiencing slower sales
Mr. Newton said he accepted the resignation of Thomas Wilson vice president of corporate sales and that his marketing responsibilities have been reassigned
The company said Mr. Wilson 's resignation was n't related to the sales shortfall
Relational Technology went public in May nineteen eighty eight at fourteen dollars a share
It fell one point eight seven five dollars a share Friday to six dollars and twenty five cents a new low in over the counter trading
Its high for the past year was sixteen point three seven five dollars a share
In the previous quarter the company earned four point five million dollars or thirty seven cents a share on sales of forty seven point two million dollars
The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden a great zoo its own charming Little Italy on Arthur Avenue and of course the Yankees
However most people having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx look at the borough the way Tom Wolfe 's Sherman McCoy did in Bonfire of the Vanities as a wrong turn into hell
But Laura Cunningham 's Bronx her childhood Bronx of the fifties is something else altogether
Ms. Cunningham a novelist and playwright has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall
She transforms her Bronx of the emotions a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria into the Babylonian Bronx a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue
For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl outwardly ordinary inwardly ornate owing all inspiration to heathen cultures
Sharp witted and funny but never mean she 's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote if he 'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy
Little Lily as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book really was n't ordinary
She was raised for the first eight years by her mother Rosie whom she remembers as a loving liar who realigned history to explain why Lily 's father did n't live with them
Rosie reinvented this man who may or may not have known about his child as a war hero for Lily 's benefit
Rosie died young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure who did n't interfere much with her child 's education on the streets
The games Bronx children played holding kids down and stripping them for example seem tame by today 's crack standards but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure
Without official knowledge of sex or death we flirted with both she writes
She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements
Her friend Susan whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents ' bedroom as though she were a temporary visitor
Her friend Diana 's father was a professional thief they did n't seem to have any bedrooms at all
Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting
When Rosie died her uncles moved in and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements
They painted the apartment orange pink and white according to her instructions
They came by their strangeness honestly
Lily 's grandmother no cookie baker excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album and lugged around her perennial work in progress Philosophy for Women
The book loses some momentum toward the end when Lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family
For the most part though there 's much pleasure in her saucy poignant probe into the mysteries of the Babylonian Bronx
The Bronx also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman 's latest novel which flashes back to the New York of the fifties
But both the past and present worlds of The Current Climate Atlantic Monthly Press two hundred pages eighteen dollars and ninety five cents feel cramped and static
For his sixth novel Mr. Friedman tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his nineteen seventy two work About Harry Towns
Harry is now a fifty seven year old writer whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out of synch
Harry fondly remembers the old days of the early seventies when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong
An L. A. solution explains Mr. Friedman
Line by line Mr. Friedman 's weary cynicism can be amusing especially when he 's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme the way people size each other up immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it
But it does n't take too many lines to figure Harry out
He 's a bore
Gulf Resources & Chemical Corporation said it agreed to pay one point five million dollars as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho
In nineteen eighty four the E. P. A. notified Gulf Resources which was a part owner of the smelter that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal Superfund program
The twenty one square mile area is contaminated with lead zinc and other metals
Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter 's cleanup costs
The company said that as part of its agreement with the E. P. A. it made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization
The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval the company said
Gulf Resources added that it will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the Superfund law
Under the agreement Gulf must give the U. S. government forty five days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock
The company 's net worth can not fall below one hundred eighty five million dollars after the dividends are issued
The terms of that agreement only become effective the date of Gulf 's reorganization which we anticipate will occur sometime in early nineteen ninety said Lawrence R. Mehl Gulf 's general counsel
In addition Gulf must give the government twenty days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding fifty million dollars that are made to the Bermuda based holding company
Gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be at least one hundred fifty million dollars
Separately the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early nineteen ninety to vote on its proposed reorganization
Many of the nation 's highest ranking executives saluted Friday 's market plunge as an overdue comeuppance for speculators and takeover players
If we get rid of a lot of that nonsense it will be a big plus
A few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the Business Council a group that meets to discuss national issues were only too happy to personalize their criticism
People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy outs do something about takeovers do something about Donald Trump said Rand Araskog chairman of I. T. T. Corporation whose stock dropped three point three seven five dollars
Where 's the leadership
Where 's the guy who can say Enough is enough
The executives were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even though it lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies and millions off their personal fortunes
I did n't bother calling anybody I did n't even turn on T. V.
There has n't been any fundamental change in the economy added John Smale whose Procter & Gamble Company took an eight dollars and seventy five cents slide to close at one hundred twenty dollars and seventy five cents
The fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem
Of course established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists
Indeed one chief executive who was downright delighted by Friday 's events was Robert Crandall chairman of A. M. R. Corporation the parent of American Airlines and the target of a takeover offer by Mr. Trump
Asked whether Friday 's action could help him avoid being Trumped by the New York real estate magnate Mr. Crandall smiled broadly and said No comment
On Friday morning before the market 's sell off the business leaders issued a report predicting the economy would grow at roughly an inflation adjusted two percent annual rate through next year then accelerate anew in nineteen ninety one
The real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market
In Manhattan once desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill
Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom
There is an unbelievable amount of space available says Faith Consolo senior vice president at Garrick Aug Associates Store Leasing Incorporated
There are about two thousand stores for rent up from a more typical range of one thousand two hundred to one thousand five hundred
This further confuses retailers she says
They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down
Is this the wrong time to open a store
Who is going to be in the space next door
In addition Ms. Consolo says tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one quarter lower than landlords ' initial asking price
A handful of hot retail locations such as the fifty seventh Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents
And in some neighborhoods rents have merely hit a plateau
But on average Manhattan retail rents have dropped ten percent to fifteen percent in the past six months alone experts say
That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since nineteen eighty six
The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing
As businesses contract or depart the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks says Edward A. Friedman senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Incorporated
He says financial problems plaguing electronics fur and furniture companies key categories in the local retail economy have further deflated the market
Hardest hit are what he calls secondary sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents
In these locations Mr. Friedman says Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined
Weakness in the restaurant industry which is leaving retail space vacant exacerbates the problem for landlords
It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores which anchor retail neighborhoods are in doubt
Hooker Corporation parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman 's is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner Campeau Corporation
The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents
But despite the recent softening for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late nineteen seventies when their leases were signed
Certainly the recent drop in prices does n't mean Manhattan comes cheap
New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U. S. cities
Madison and Fifth Avenues and East fifty seventh Street can command rents of up to five hundred dollars a square foot and two hundred fifty dollars is not uncommon
The thriving thirty fourth Street area offers rents of about one hundred dollars a square foot as do up and coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue
By contrast rentals in the best retail locations in Boston San Francisco and Chicago rarely top one hundred dollars a square foot
And rents on Beverly Hills ' Rodeo Drive generally do n't exceed about one hundred twenty five dollars a square foot

When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his thirty fourth year on the Supreme Court today the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure
For the first time the eighty three year old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent rather than as a force in the high court 's majority
This role reversal holds true as well for his three liberal and moderate allies Justices Thurgood Marshall Harry Blackmun and John Stevens
But are these four players three of them in their 80s ready to assume a different role after eighty eight years collectively of service on the high court
Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role and the frustrations that go with it but in different ways
Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad
The four justices are no newcomers to dissent often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court 's conservative drift
But always in years past they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases
Now however as the court 's new five member conservative majority continues to solidify victories for the liberals are rare
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan the last survivor of the mid nineteen sixties liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren
Last term alone he cast fifty two dissenting votes in one hundred thirty three decisions with the contentious flag burning ruling as his only big victory
But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role strongly defending the importance of dissents in a nineteen eighty five speech
Each time the court revisits an issue the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result he said
Moreover in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the nineteen sixties he knew that the tables might turn in the future
He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court 's opinions
Associates of eighty one year old Justice Marshall say he was depressed about the court 's direction last spring but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights
We could sweep it under the rug and hide it but I 'm not going to do it he said in a speech last month
He like Justice Brennan considers dissents highly important for the future a point that has n't escaped legal scholars
Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a generation skipping flavor to current dissents
The dissenters in the Warren Court he says appeared to be writing for the short term suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon
Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future he says
Justice Blackmun who will turn eighty one next month also seems feisty about his new role
Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his nineteen seventy three opinion Roe versus Wade
Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years
And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in August
But his level of frustration showed in a recent impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago
He concluded his remarks by quoting emotionally and at some length according to those present the late Martin Luther King 's famous I Have a Dream speech from the nineteen sixty three March on Washington
If the role these four dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern Supreme Court history it also differs in an important way from recent history court watchers say
The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited says Professor A. E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created
The government sold the deposits of four savings and loan institutions in its first wave of sales of big sick thrifts but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth
Two of the four big thrifts were sold to N. C. N. B. Corporation Charlotte N. C. which has aggressively expanded its markets particularly in Texas and Florida
A Canadian bank bought another thrift in the first R. T. C. transaction with a foreign bank
Under these deals the R. T. C. sells just the deposits and the healthy assets
These clean bank transactions leave the bulk of bad assets mostly real estate with the government to be sold later
In these four for instance the R. T. C. is stuck with four point five one billion dollars in bad assets
Acquirers paid premiums ranging from one point five percent to three point seven percent for the deposits and branch systems roughly in line with what analysts were expecting
The buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks as has been the case with previous deals
After that the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts
But it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps
N. C. N. B. for example has been one of the highest rate payers in the Texas market and in Florida rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities
The R. T. C. had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency
These thrifts are beached whales said Bert Ely an industry consultant based in Alexandria Va
N. C. N. B. continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets
N. C. N. B. will acquire University Federal Savings Association Houston which had assets of two point eight billion dollars
N. C. N. B. Texas National Bank will pay the R. T. C. a premium of one hundred twenty nine million dollars for three point five billion dollars in deposits
N. C. N. B. also acquired Freedom Savings & Loan Association Tampa Florida which had total assets of nine hundred million dollars
N. C. N. B. will pay the R. T. C. a premium of forty point four million dollars for one point one billion dollars in deposits
N. C. N. B. will also acquire two hundred sixty six million dollars of Freedom 's assets from the R. T. C. which will require eight hundred seventy five million dollars in assistance
Meridian Bancorp Incorporated Reading Pennsylvania will acquire Hill Financial Savings Association Red Hill Pennsylvania which had two point three billion dollars in assets
Meridian will pay a premium of thirty point five million dollars to assume two billion dollars in deposits
It will also purchase eight hundred forty five million dollars of the thrift 's assets with one point nine billion dollars in R. T. C. assistance
In the first R. T. C. transaction with a foreign buyer Royal Trustco Limited Toronto will acquire Pacific Savings Bank Costa Mesa California which had nine hundred forty nine million dollars in assets
Royal Trustco will pay the R. T. C. twenty five million dollars to assume nine hundred eighty nine million dollars in deposits
It will also purchase four hundred seventy three million dollars in assets and receive five hundred fifty million dollars in assistance from the R. T. C.

Time magazine in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways
However because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered ad rates will be effectively seven point five percent higher per subscriber according to Richard Heinemann Time associate publisher
Time is following the course of some other mass circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high and expensive circulations is the way to draw advertisers
In recent years Reader 's Digest New York Times Company 's McCall 's and most recently News Corporation 's T. V. Guide have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers
Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper competitive world of magazine news weeklies
But Time as part of the more cost conscious Time Warner wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks
Besides Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky
Giveaways just give people the wrong image said Mr. Heinemann
That perception takes the focus off the magazine
Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers
What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it said Mr. Heinemann
We are trying to create quality and involvement
However Time executives used the same explanation when in October nineteen eighty eight the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from four point six million to four point three million
And Time 's paid circulation according to Audit Bureau of Circulations dropped seven point three percent to four million three hundred ninety three thousand two hundred thirty seven in the six months ended June thirtieth nineteen eighty nine
Still Time 's move is being received well once again
It 's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more said Michael Drexler national media director at Bozell Incorporated ad agency
A few drops in circulation are of no consequence
It 's not a show of weakness they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits
Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away
The question is how much are we getting from each reader said Mr. Heinemann
Time 's rivals news weeklies Washington Post Company 's Newsweek and U. S. News & World Report are less reliant on electronic giveaways and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases
Both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for nineteen ninety within a month
When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago Senator Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing
They said follow C. N. N. he told reporters
That shows how far Ted Turner 's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago when it was considered the laughingstock of television news
It is bigger faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks
Its niche as the network of record during major crises draws elite audiences around the world
But for all its success C. N. N. has hit a plateau
Although viewership soars when big news breaks it ebbs during periods of calm
C. N. N. executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable T. V.
Just the fact we 're on twenty four hours is no longer bulletin says Ed Turner C. N. N. 's executive vice president news gathering and no relation to Ted Turner
You ca n't live on that
So C. N. N. a unit of Atlanta based Turner Broadcasting System Incorporated is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network
Tonight to kick off the effort C. N. N. will premiere its first prime time newscast in years an hourlong show at six p.m Eastern time to air head to head against the network newscasts
The show will be co anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier a thirty four year old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism
The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full length signature programming with recognizable stars
To distinguish itself C. N. N. is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global news program
It is paying higher salaries after years of scrimping to lure and keep experienced staffers
And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative reporting team
But that wo n't be easy
Networks like other consumer products develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change
It also takes money that C. N. N. has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see
And the cable T. V. operators C. N. N. 's distributors and part owners like things just the way they are
The repositioning bid is aimed at C. N. N. 's unsteady viewership and what may happen to it as the cable T. V. news market grows more competitive
Already C. N. N. is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Incorporated and General Electric Company 's Consumer News and Business Channel both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future
In addition many cable T. V. systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations
C. N. N. wants to change its viewers ' habits
Its watchers are on the whole a disloyal group of channel zapping grazers and news junkies who spend an average of just twenty six minutes a day watching C. N. N. according to audience research
That 's less than one third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks
The brief attention viewers give C. N. N. could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data and advertising become more important to cable T. V. channels
C. N. N. 's viewer habits have been molded by its format
Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a T. V. wire service
It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks
It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called Daybreak Daywatch Newsday and Newsnight but the shows varied little in content personality or look
Now the push is on for more distinctive shows
Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity says Paul Amos C. N. N. executive vice president for programming
Accordingly C. N. N. is adding a world affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global news hour in the afternoon is among its most differentiated programs in viewers ' minds says Mr. Amos
And it is exploring other original programs similar to its Larry King Live and Crossfire talk shows which executives hope will keep people tuned in
Then there 's The World Today the prime time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier
Until now C. N. N. has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period
But seventy percent of the cable television equipped households that watch news do so between six thirty p. m. and seven p. m. the network discovered so C. N. N. wants in
Mr. Amos says the Shaw Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day with most of the program at least for now appearing similar to C. N. N. 's other newcasts
Some in the industry are skeptical
The evening news is also slated as C. N. N. 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism
In August the network hired award winning producer Pamela Hill the former head of news specials at A. B. C.
She 's assembling a staff of about thirty five investigative reporters who will produce weekly in depth segments with an eye toward breaking big stories
C. N. N. executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its branded programs in the way sixty Minutes did so well for C. B. S.
That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical C. N. N. will follow through with its investigative commitment especially after it sees the cost of producing in depth pieces
They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production says Michael Mosettig a senior producer with MacNeil Lehrer NewsHour who notes that C. N. N. is indispensable to his job
The network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards resulting in a less experienced work force
C. N. N. recently gave most employees raises of as much as fifteen percent but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks
Says Mr. Mosettig C. N. N. is my wire service they 're on top of everything
But to improve they 've really got to make the investment in people
In any case cable T. V. system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with C. N. N. 's format
They market cable T. V. on the very grazing opportunities C. N. N. seeks to discourage
We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general interest long format programming says Robert Stengel senior vice president programming of Continental Cablevision Incorporated which holds a two percent stake in Turner Broadcasting
The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound
In the Pennzoil Texaco litigation the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound
Admittedly the principle in the cases is the same
But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts
And the facts as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits were different
When you suggest otherwise you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation

Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said Imperial Corporation of America withdrew from regulators its application to buy five Valley Federal branches leaving the transaction in limbo
The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received
The transaction announced in August included about one hundred forty six million dollars in deposits at the five outlets in California 's San Joaquin Valley
Terms were n't disclosed but Valley Federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about two million dollars in operating costs annually
Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corporation which said it is attempting to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements
Valley Federal with assets of three point three billion dollars is based in Van Nuys
Imperial Corporation based in San Diego is the parent of Imperial Savings & Loan
In the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of thirty three point one million dollars
Call it the we 're too broke to fight defense
Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers developers and creditors
Though the argument may have a common sense ring to it even the S. & L. lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position
Still one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law
The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills which topped seventy three million dollars last year
Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch
If true the court wrote this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds
But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas
This institution is just brain dead says Mr. Haworth a partner in the Dallas office of Andrews & Kurth a Houston law firm
But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group the developer of Valley Ranch dismisses such arguments as a defense du jour
Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award including the reversal of Sunbelt 's foreclosure on Valley Ranch
We 're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory he says
We 'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize

The seventy seven year old Sisulu sentenced to life in nineteen sixty four along with black nationalist Nelson Mandela for plotting to overthrow the government said equality for blacks in South Africa was in reach
The releases announced last week by President de Klerk were viewed as Pretoria 's tacit legalization of the A. N. C.

A group of Arby 's franchisees said they formed an association to oppose Miami Beach financier Victor Posner 's control of the restaurant chain
The decision is the latest move in an escalating battle between the franchisees and Mr. Posner that began in August
At the time a group called R. B. Partners Limited consisting of eight of Arby 's largest franchisees offered more than two hundred million dollars to buy Arby 's Incorporated which is part of D. W. G. Corporation
D. W. G. is a holding company controlled by Mr. Posner
One week later Leonard H. Roberts president and chief executive officer of Arby 's was fired in a dispute with Mr. Posner
Friday forty two franchisees announced the formation of an association called A. P. Association Incorporated to preserve the integrity of the Arby 's system
We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby 's Incorporated and the Arby 's system
The group said it would consider among other things withholding royalty payments and initiating a class action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings

September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday
After falling for three consecutive months the producer price index for finished goods shot up zero point nine percent last month the Labor Department reported Friday as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer
Analysts immediately viewed the price data the grimmest inflation news in months as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped
That rise came on top of a zero point seven percent gain in August and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy
I think the Friday report combined with the actions of the Fed weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy said Robert Dederick chief economist at Northern Trust Company in Chicago
But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers
But Sung Won Sohn chief economist at Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump
I would say this is not bad news this is a blip he said
The core rate is not really out of line
All year energy prices have skewed the producer price index which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods
Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter when a steep run up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double digit annual rates
Energy prices then plummeted through the summer causing the index to decline for three consecutive months
Overall the index has climbed at a five point one percent compound annual rate since the start of the year the Labor Department said
While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year that is still a steeper rise than the four point oh percent increase for all of nineteen eighty eight
Moreover this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month when energy prices zoomed up six point five percent after plunging seven point three percent in August
Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain
Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index but the zero point nine percent climb was higher than most anticipated
I think the resurgence in inflation is going to continue for a few months said John Mueller chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon a Washington economic forecasting firm
He predicted that inflation will moderate next year saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world wide
But Dirk Van Dongen president of the National Association of Wholesaler Distributors said that last month 's rise is n't as bad an omen as the zero point nine percent figure suggests
If you examine the data carefully the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices rather than being a broad based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods he explained
Passenger car prices jumped three point eight percent in September after climbing zero point five percent in August and declining in the late spring and summer
Many analysts said the September increase was a one time event coming as dealers introduced their nineteen ninety models
Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase
Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty one point one percent in September while prices for home electronic equipment fell one point one percent
Food prices declined zero point six percent after climbing zero point three percent in August
Meanwhile the retail sales report showed that car sales rose zero point eight percent in September to thirty two point eight two billion dollars
But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices analysts said
Sales at general merchandise stores rose one point seven percent after declining zero point six percent in August while sales of building materials fell one point eight percent after rising one point seven percent
Producer prices for intermediate goods grew zero point four percent in September after dropping for three consecutive months
Prices for crude goods an array of raw materials jumped one point one percent after declining one point nine percent in August and edging up zero point two percent in July
Here are the Labor Department 's producer price indexes nineteen eighty two = one hundred for September before seasonal adjustment and the percentage changes from September nineteen eighty eight
CityFed Financial Corporation said it expects to report a loss of at least one hundred twenty five million to one hundred fifty million dollars for the third quarter
In the year earlier period CityFed had net income of four hundred eighty five thousand dollars but no per share earnings
CityFed 's president and chief executive officer John Atherton said the loss stems from several factors
He said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than seven hundred million dollars from five hundred sixteen million dollars between June and September
Approximately eighty five percent of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets
Accordingly CityFed estimated that it will provide between eighty five million and one hundred ten million dollars for credit losses in the third quarter
CityFed added that significant additional loan loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of City Federal Savings Bank CityFed 's primary subsidiary based in Somerset N. J.
City Federal operates one hundred five banking offices in New Jersey and Florida
Mr. Atherton said CityFed will also mark its portfolio of high yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions divest themselves of such bonds
That action CityFed said will result in a charge against third quarter results of approximately thirty million dollars
CityFed also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origination operations outside its principal markets in New Jersey and Florida and as a result is taking a charge for discontinued operations
All these actions Mr. Atherton said will result in a loss of one hundred twenty five million dollars to one hundred fifty million dollars for the third quarter
CenTrust Savings Bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened
In a statement Miami based CenTrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and apparent losses in its junk bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends
Regulators also ordered CenTrust to stop buying back the preferred stock
David L. Paul chairman and chief executive officer criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision which issued the directive saying it was inappropriate and based on insufficient reasons
He said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision
The suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health
In March regulators labeled CenTrust a troubled institution largely because of its big junk bond holdings and its operating losses
In the same month the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track
For the nine months ended June thirtieth CenTrust had a net loss of twenty one point three million dollars compared with year earlier net income of fifty two point eight million dollars
CenTrust which is Florida 's largest thrift holds one of the largest junk bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation
Since April it has pared its high yield bond holdings to about eight hundred ninety million dollars from one point three five billion dollars
Mr. Paul said only about one hundred fifty million dollars of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
The remainder he said are commercial loan participations or private placements that are n't filed with the S. E. C. and do n't have a ready market
CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds
Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust 's and other thrifts ' junk bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk bond market
The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new somber regulatory climate
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday CenTrust common shares closed at three dollars down twelve point five cents
In a statement Friday Mr. Paul challenged the regulators ' decision saying the thrift 's operating losses and apparent junk bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank
He also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds
In the third quarter for instance CenTrust added twenty two point five million dollars to its general reserves
Mr. Paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with approving CenTrust 's request to sell sixty three of its seventy one branches to Great Western Bank a unit of Great Western Financial Corporation based in Beverly Hills Calif
The branch sale is the centerpiece of CenTrust 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional S. & L. from a high flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits according to Mr. Paul
Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction which was announced in July long before now
Many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal
Branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution
CenTrust however touts the branch sale saying it would bring in one hundred fifty million dollars and reduce the thrift 's assets to six point seven billion dollars from nine billion dollars
CenTrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about one hundred eighty million dollars
Critics however say the branch sale will make CenTrust more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds
Mr. Paul counters that he intends to further pare the size of CenTrust by not renewing more than one billion dollars of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due
The thrift is also working to unload its junk bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate as required under the new thrift law
On a recent Saturday night in the midst of West Germany 's most popular prime time show a contestant bet the host that she could name any of one hundred different cheeses after just one nibble while blindfolded
The woman won the bet
But perhaps even more remarkable the three hour show Wetten Dass Make a Bet regularly wins the top slot in the country 's T. V. ratings sometimes drawing as many as fifty percent of West German households
As the nineteen ninety two economic integration approaches Europe 's cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against American cultural imperialism threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as Dallas Miami Vice and L. A. Law
But much of what the Europeans want to protect seems every bit as cheesy as what they are trying to keep out
The most militant opposition to American T. V. imports has come from French television and movie producers who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full sixty percent of Europe 's T. V. shows be produced in Europe
So far the French have failed to win enough broad based support to prevail
A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why
While there are some popular action and drama series few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect
More European air time is filled with low budget game shows variety hours movies and talk shows many of which are authorized knock offs of their American counterparts
One of France 's most popular Saturday night programs features semi celebrities seeking out their grammar school classmates for on air reunions
A Flemish game show has as its host a Belgian pretending to be Italian
Topping the cheese stunt on another typical evening of fun on Wetten Dass a contestant won a bet with the show 's host Thomas Gottschalk that he could identify three hundred German dialects over the telephone
A celebrity guest U. S. Ambassador to West Germany Richard Burt also won a bet that someone could pile up one hundred fifty worth dollars of quarters on a slanted coin
Mr. Burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost agreeing to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes
If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get
European programs usually target only their own local audience and often only a small portion of that
Mega hits in Germany or Italy rarely make it even to France or Great Britain and almost never show up on U. S. screens
Attempts to produce pan European programs have generally resulted in disappointment
One annual co production the three hour long Eurovision Song Contest featuring soft rock songs from each of twenty European countries has been described as the world 's most boring T. V. show
Another Jeux Sans Frontieres where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks is a hit in France
A U. S. made imitation under the title Almost Anything Goes flopped fast
For the most part what 's made here stays here and for good reason
The cream of the British crop the literary dramas that are shown on U. S. public television as Masterpiece Theater make up a relatively small part of British air time
Most British programming is more of an acquired taste
There is for instance One Man and His Dog a herding contest among sheep dogs
Also riveting to the British are hours of dart throwing championships even more hours of lawn bowling contests and still more hours of snooker marathons
European drama has had better though still mixed fortunes
The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns
A French knock off of Dallas called Chateauvallon and set in a French vineyard had a good run in France which ended after the female lead was injured in a real life auto accident
Schwarzwaldklinik Black Forest Clinic a kind of German St Elsewhere set in a health spa is popular in Germany and has spread into France
Italy 's most popular series is a drama called La Piovra or The Octopus which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in Palermo against the Mafia
It was front page news in Italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series
Spain 's most popular mini series this year was Juncal the story of an aging bullfighter
The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular with American programs second says Brian Wenham a former director of programs for the British Broadcasting Corporation
Given a choice everybody will watch a home produced show
But frequently there is n't much choice
Thus Europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own programs with broader appeal
We 've basically got to start from scratch to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see concedes Colin Young head of Britain 's National Film Theatre School
While some in the U. S. contend that advertising is the bane of television here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European T. V. industry 's sluggish development
Until recently national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising
Since production costs were guaranteed it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication as most American programs are
But not much money was spent on the shows either a situation that encouraged cheap to make talk and game shows while discouraging expensive to produce dramas
Now however commercial channels are coming to most European countries and at the same time satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly
Just last week Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time Spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels
The result is a new and huge appetite for programming
But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available reruns usually of shows made in the U. S.
Sky Channel a British based venture of Australian American press tycoon Rupert Murdoch offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience
The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss 's other ventures

British Aerospace P. L. C. and France 's Thomson C. S. F. S. A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided missile divisions greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors
The fifty fifty joint venture which may be dubbed Eurodynamics would have combined annual sales of at least one point four billion pounds two point one seven billion dollars and would be among the world 's largest missile makers
After two years of talks plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance
The companies hope for a final agreement by year end
The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting
In recent months a string of cross border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once balkanized world of European arms manufacture
Already British Aerospace and French government controlled Thomson C. S. F. collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air traffic control radar system
Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal P. L. C. a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U. S. unit
The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson C. S. F. traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts is stirring controversy in Western Europe 's defense industry
Most threatened by closer British Aerospace Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals including Matra S. A. in France and Britain 's General Electric Company P. L. C.
But neither Matra nor G. E. C. unrelated to Stamford Connecticut based General Electric Company are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces
Yesterday a source close to G. E. C. confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson C. S. F.
Companies with which G. E. C. has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra Britain 's Dowty Group P. L. C. West Germany 's Daimler Benz A. G. and France 's Dassault group
But it may be weeks before G. E. C. and its potential partners decide whether to bid the source indicated
A consortium bid however would diminish G. E. C. 's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials
A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with G. E. C. for Ferranti Competition is the name of the game she said
At least one potential G. E. C. partner Matra insists it is n't interested in Ferranti
We have nothing to say about this affair which does n't concern us a Matra official said Sunday
The missile venture the British Aerospace spokeswoman said is a needed response to the new environment in defense contracting
The venture 's importance for Thomson is great
Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans
The European defense industry is consolidating for instance West Germany 's Siemens A. G. recently joined G. E. C. in a takeover of Britain 's Plessey Company and Daimler Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt Boelkow Blohm G.m.b H
In missiles Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival France 's Aerospatiale S. A. to better compete Thomson officials say they need a partnership
To justify fifty fifty ownership of the planned venture Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace
Annual revenue of British Aerospace 's missile business is about nine hundred fifty million pounds a Thomson spokesman said
British Aerospace 's chief missile products include its seventeen year old family of Rapier surface to air missiles
Thomson missile products with about half British Aerospace 's annual revenue include the Crotale surface to air missile family
Canadian crude production averaged about one point six nine million barrels a day during nineteen eighty nine 's first half about one percent below the nineteen eighty eight level
Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about two percent since January and is expected to fall further making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid nineteen nineties
There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side he said
Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly
Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature conventional fields in western Canada
Interprovincial transports about seventy five percent of all crude produced in western Canada and almost sixty percent of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude
That ranks Canada as the fourth largest source of imported crude behind Saudi Arabia Nigeria and Mexico
Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output combined with the fast shrinking output of U. S. crude will help intensify U. S. reliance on oil from overseas particularly the Middle East
It 's very much a growing concern
But when something is inevitable you learn to live with it he said
Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase U. S. dependence on offshore crude however since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada 's falling output
Under terms of its proposed two step expansion which would have required regulatory approval Interprovincial intended to add two hundred thousand barrels a day of additional capacity to its system beginning with a modest expansion by nineteen ninety one
The system currently has a capacity of one point five five million barrels a day
Inland Steel Industries Incorporated expects to report that third quarter earnings dropped more than fifty percent from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs
The company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by two hundred thousand tons in the latest quarter compared with the second quarter
At the same time the integrated steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses as well as higher labor costs under its new contract
The service center business was hurt by reduced margins and start up costs associated with its Joseph T. Ryerson & Son unit
The company said it is beginning to see some shipping rate improvements in both the intergrated steel and steel service center segments which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter
Inland said its third quarter results will be announced later this week
Predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately
Take Microsoft Corporation the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether
In July the company stunned Wall Street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only ten percent in nineteen ninety a modest increase when compared with the sizzling expansion of years past
But that was all of three months ago
Last week Microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended September thirtieth to increase thirty four percent
The announcement caused the company 's stock to surge six dollars and fifty cents to close at seventy five dollars and fifty cents a share
Microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms
It 's hard to know what to expect at this point said Peter Rogers an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co
The industry defies characterization
To illustrate Mr. Rogers said that of the fourteen computer related firms he follows half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results and half above those results
Among those companies expected to have a down quarter are Hewlett Packard Company Amdahl Corporation and Sun Microsystems Incorporated generally solid performers in the past
International Business Machines Corporation also is expected to report disappointing results
Apple Computer Incorporated meanwhile is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended Sept
Another contradictory message comes from Businessland Incorporated a computer retailer
This month however Businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended September thirtieth had n't met expectations
The company said it expects earnings of fourteen to seventeen cents a share down from twenty five cents a share in the year earlier period
While the earnings picture confuses observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer
Companies will continue to war over standards
In computer publishing a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Incorporated which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays
Until recently Adobe had a lock on the market for image software but last month Apple Adobe 's biggest customer and Microsoft rebelled
Now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to Adobe 's approach and analysts say they are likely to carry I. B. M. the biggest seller of personal computers along with them
The short term outlook for Adobe 's business however appears strong
The company is beginning to ship a new software program that 's being heralded as a boon for owners of low end printers sold by Apple
The program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material
John Warnock Adobe 's chief executive officer said the Mountain View California company has been receiving one thousand calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago
Meanwhile competition between various operating systems which control the basic functions of a computer spells trouble for software firms generally
It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales said Russ Crabs an analyst at Soundview Financial Group
Mr. Crabs said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of Aldus Corporation maker of a widely used computer publishing program
Aldus officials could n't be reached for comment
On the other hand the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant
A bus is the data highway within a computer
I. B. M. is backing one type of bus called microchannel while the nine other leading computer makers including H. P. and Compaq Computer Corporation have chosen another method
Users do n't care about the bus said Daniel Benton an analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co
He said Apple 's family of Macintosh computers for instance uses four different buses and no one seems to mind
The gap between winners and laggards will grow
In personal computers Apple Compaq and I. B. M. are expected to tighten their hold on their business
At the same time second tier firms will continue to lose ground
Some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether
Wyse Technology for instance is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation
Wyse has done well establishing a distribution business but they have n't delivered products that sell said Kimball Brown an analyst at Prudential Bache Securities
Mr. Brown estimates Wyse whose terminals business is strong will report a loss of twelve cents a share for its quarter ended Sept
Personal computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms
Ever more powerful desk top computers designed with one or more microprocessors as their brains are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes
The guys that make traditional hardware are really being obsoleted by microprocessor based machines said Mr. Benton
As a result of this trend longtime powerhouses H. P. I. B. M. and Digital Equipment Corporation are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor based systems of their own
But they will have to act quickly
Mr. Benton expects Compaq to unveil a family of high end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk top machines
A raft of new computer companies also has targeted this server market
Population Drain Ends For Midwestern States
IOWA IS MAKING a comeback
So are Indiana Ohio and Michigan
The population of all four states is on the upswing according to new Census Bureau estimates following declines throughout the early nineteen eighties
The gains to be sure are rather small
Iowa for instance saw its population grow by eleven thousand people or zero point four percent between nineteen eighty seven and nineteen eighty eight the Census Bureau says
Still even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since nineteen eighty one
Between nineteen eighty seven and nineteen eighty eight North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population a loss of four thousand people
Six of the twelve midwestern states have been growing steadily since nineteen eighty Illinois Kansas Minnesota Missouri South Dakota and Wisconsin
The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race
Seven of nine states have grown each year since nineteen eighty including New York which lost four percent of its population during the nineteen seventies
And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade they are growing again
At the same time several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround
Seven states that grew in the early nineteen eighties are now losing population West Virginia Mississippi Louisiana Oklahoma Montana Wyoming and Alaska
Overall though the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest and fast growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue
But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing
More Elderly Maintain Their Independence
THANKS TO modern medicine more couples are growing old together
And even after losing a spouse more of the elderly are staying independent
A new Census Bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that sixty four percent of people aged sixty five to seventy four were living with a spouse in nineteen eighty eight up from fifty nine percent in nineteen seventy
This does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone however
That share has remained at about twenty four percent since nineteen seventy
What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives such as children
In nineteen eighty eight ten percent of those aged sixty five to seventy four lived with relatives other than spouses down from fifteen percent in nineteen seventy
As people get even older many become widowed
But even among those aged seventy five and older the share living with a spouse rose slightly to forty percent in nineteen eighty eight from thirty eight percent in nineteen seventy
Like their younger counterparts the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives
Only seventeen percent of those aged seventy five and older lived with relatives other than spouses in nineteen eighty eight down from twenty six percent in nineteen seventy
The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of seventy five has increased to forty percent from thirty two percent
More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially
Careers Count Most For the Well to Do
MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family
At least that 's what a survey by Ernst & Young and Yankelovich Clancy Shulman indicates
Two thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families
Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group
Unlike most studies of the affluent market this survey excluded the super rich
Average household income for the sample was one hundred ninety four thousand dollars and average net assets were reported as seven hundred seventy five thousand dollars
The goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest growing income groups the upper middle class
Although they represent only two percent of the population they control nearly one third of discretionary income
Across the board these consumers value quality buy what they like rather than just what they need and appreciate products that are distinctive
Despite their considerable incomes and assets forty percent of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure and one fourth do n't feel that they have made it
Twenty percent do n't even feel they are financially well off
Many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves either
About forty percent do n't feel they 're more able than others
While twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent only twenty five percent give two thousand five hundred dollars or more to charity each year
Thirty five percent attend religious services regularly at the same time sixty percent feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles
Odds and Ends
THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since nineteen seventy eight
The American Bankers Association says that women make up forty seven percent of officials and managers in the top fifty banks up from thirty three percent in nineteen seventy eight
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to sixteen percent from twelve percent
Per capita personal income in the U. S. grew faster than inflation last year according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis
Per capita personal income ranged from eleven thousand one hundred sixteen dollars in Mississippi to twenty three thousand fifty nine dollars in Connecticut
There are thirteen point one million students in college this fall up two percent from nineteen eighty eight the National Center for Education Statistics estimates
About fifty four percent are women and forty four percent are part time students
This small Dallas suburb 's got trouble
Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for pool
More than thirty years ago Professor Harold Hill the con man in Meredith Willson 's The Music Man warned the citizens of River City Iowa against the game
Now kindred spirits on Addison 's town council have barred the town 's fanciest hotel the Grand Kempinski from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge
Mayor Lynn Spruill and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along Addison 's main street
And the mayor in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to Professor Hill 's warned that alcohol leads to betting which leads to fights
The council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years
Obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on says Tom Manske vice president of the National Pocket Billiards Association
Pool is hot in New York and Chicago he insists where upscale suit and tie places are adding tables
With today 's tougher drunk driving laws he adds people do n't want to just sit around and drink
Besides rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the Grand Kempinski where rooms average two hundred dollars a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for three dollars and fifty cents a pop
At the lounge manager Elizabeth Dyer wo n't admit patrons in jeans T. shirts or tennis shoes
But a majority of the Addison council did n't buy those arguments
Introducing pool argued Councilwoman Riley Reinker would be dangerous
It would open a can of worms
Addison is no stranger to cans of worms either
After its previous mayor committed suicide last year an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's coffers for trips and retreats
The revelations embarrassed town officials although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested
Now comes the pool flap
I think there 's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous Councilman John Nolan says
I thought this was all taken care of in The Music Man
The only thing Robert Goldberg could praise about C. B. S. 's new show Island Son Leisure & Arts September twenty fifth was the local color unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework
For instance Haole white is not the ultimate insult Mainland haole is
Richard Chamberlain dresses as a Mainland haole tucking in a Hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves
And the local expression for brother is brah not bruddah
And even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left not right ear
Sorry the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color

Of all the ethnic tensions in America which is the most troublesome right now
A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City
Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new A. B. C. sitcom airing on Tuesday nights nine thirty ten p. m. E. D. T.
Not only is Mr. Mason the star of Chicken Soup he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to Duck Soup and he 's currently a man in hot water
Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks so they support black candidates uncritically
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates uncritically
He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa
Of course Mr. Mason did not use neutral language
As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt live television and the nightclub circuit Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular
He said Jews were sick with complexes and he called David Dinkins Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent a fancy shvartze with a mustache
If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers would the water be quite so hot
It probably would because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language
In addition some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism
For example the New York state counsel for the N. Double A. C. P. said that Mr. Mason is like a dinosaur
People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck
These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group such as Polish jokes and the type that is double edged aiming inward as well as outward
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves
In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce this double edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons
But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason it is a constructive form of mischief
Why constructive
Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing they are similar in one respect Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co existence of groups in conflict
That 's why it 's dangerous to have well intentioned thought police on college campuses and elsewhere taboo all critical mention of group differences
As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer
The question is if group conflicts still exist as undeniably they do and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe then what other means do we have for letting off steam
Do n't say the T. V. sitcom because that happens to be a genre that in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy
It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer yuppies versus blue collar Bostonians in Cheers children versus adults in The Cosby Show
But these are not the differences that make headlines
In Chicken Soup Mr. Mason plays Jackie a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie Lynn Redgrave an Irish widow and mother of three against the wishes of his mother Rita Karin and her brother Michael Brandon Maggart
It 's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants
At least they both speak with strong accents as do Jackie and Maddie
It could n't be more obvious that Chicken Soup is being made from an old recipe
And a safe one imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam
Clearly the question with Chicken Soup is not whether the pot will boil over but whether it will simmer at all
So far the bubbles have been few and far between
Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear to preach about social issues
To some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them
For instance Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman but because he quits his well paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona
But too often these routines lack spark because this sitcom like all sitcoms is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade ethnic differences
I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz
That issue like racial tensions in New York City will have to cool down not heat up before it can simmer
But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about caring for other people that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America
At your age Jackie you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the flame
The official White House reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a sixty year history of calm right up through Friday
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a statement Friday that the stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy
The economy he added remains well balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth
Sound familiar
Here 's what Ronald Reagan said after the nineteen eighty seven crash The underlying economy remains sound
There is nothing wrong with the economy all the indices are up
Heard that before

The Senate 's decision to approve a bare bones deficit reduction bill without a capital gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this year
Late Friday night the Senate voted eighty seven seven to approve an estimated thirteen point five billion dollars measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened rather than narrowed the federal budget deficit
Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special interest tax breaks and spending increases
We 're putting a deficit reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit reduction bill said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser D. Tenn
But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside including a capital gains tax cut
In addition the companion deficit reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital gains provision
House Senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while
No one can predict exactly what will happen on the House side said Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole R. Kan
But he added I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital gains reform this year
White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital gains cut in the final version of the bill
We do n't need this as a way to get capital gains he said
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta D. Calif said in an interview If that 's the signal that comes from the White House that will help a great deal
The Senate 's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital gains tax cut less certain this year
Opponents of the cut are playing hardball
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D. Maine said he was confident that any House Senate agreement on the deficit reduction legislation would n't include a capital gains tax cut
And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee where tax legislation originates said there are n't any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year
One obvious place to attach a capital gains tax cut and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit reduction bill is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit
Such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month
The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit reduction through Congress
Because the legislation has n't been completed President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across the board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm Rudman deficit reduction law
Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the streamlined bill
The House appears reluctant to join the senators
A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions
Although I am encouraged by the Senate action said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski D. Ill of the House Ways and Means Committee it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate
Another big question hovering over the debate is what President Bush thinks
He has been resisting a stripped down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital gains tax cut
But Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the sixty votes needed to win the capital gains issue on the floor so they went ahead with the streamlined bill
The Senate bill was stripped of many popular though revenue losing provisions a number of which are included in the House passed bill
These include a child care initiative and extensions of soon to expire tax breaks for low income housing and research and development expenditures
Also missing from the Senate bill is the House 's repeal of a law called Section eighty nine that compels companies to give rank and file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives
Mr. Bentsen said he hopes the Senate will consider that measure soon
To the delight of some doctors the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician reimbursement system under Medicare
To the detriment of many low income people efforts to boost Medicaid funding especially in rural areas also were stricken
Asked why senators were giving up so much New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee said We 're looking like idiots
Things had just gone too far
Senator Dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator
It worked others said because there were no exceptions all revenue losing provisions were stricken
The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced
In addition the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a three percent excise tax on long distance telephone calls
It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed contract method of accounting which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden
It also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees
Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties which would have raised sixty five million dollars in fiscal nineteen ninety
A provision that would have made the Social Security Administration an independent agency was excised
The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Senator Mitchell who had proposed the streamlining
The deficit reduction bill contains five point three billion dollars in tax increases in fiscal nineteen ninety and twenty six billion dollars over five years
The revenue raising provisions which affect mostly corporations would
Prevent companies that have made leveraged buy outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy outs effective August second nineteen eighty nine
Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received effective the day after the tax bill is enacted
Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans effective June sixth nineteen eighty nine that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers
The measure repeals a fifty percent exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP if the ESOP owns less than thirty percent of the employer 's stock
Curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities such as zero coupon bonds that postpone cash interest payments
Raise eight hundred fifty one million dollars by suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes
Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies effective August nineteen ninety
Impose a tax on ozone depleting chemicals such as those used in air conditioners and in Styrofoam beginning at one dollar and ten cents a pound starting next year
Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding
Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly effective next year
Restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash
Increase to six dollars a person from three dollars the international air passenger departure tax and impose a three dollars a person tax on international departures by commercial ships
The measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees
Among its provisions
Reduction of Medicare spending in fiscal nineteen ninety by some two point eight billion dollars in part by curbing increases in reimbursements to physicians
The plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year
Removal of the U. S. Postal Service 's operating budget from the federal budget reducing the deficit by one point seven seven billion dollars
A similar provision is in the House version
Increases in Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees totaling fifty four million dollars
Direction to the U. S. Coast Guard to collect fifty million dollars from users of Coast Guard services
Raising an additional forty three million dollars by increasing existing Federal Communications Commission fees and penalties and establishing new fees for amateur radio operators ship stations and mobile radio facilities

BULL H. N. INFORMATION SYSTEMS Incorporated is a U. S. majority owned unit of Company des Machines Bull
In Friday 's edition the name of the unit was misstated
Moody 's Investors Service said it reduced its rating on one hundred sixty five million dollars of subordinated debt of this Beverly Hills California thrift citing turmoil in the market for low grade high yield securities
The agency said it reduced its rating on the thrift 's subordinated debt to B. two from Ba two and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade
Columbia Savings is a major holder of so called junk bonds
New federal legislation requires that all thrifts divest themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years
Columbia Savings officials were n't available for comment on the downgrade
FRANKLIN SAVINGS ASSOCIATION Ottawa Kansas
Moody 's Investors Service Incorporated said it downgraded its rating to B. two from Ba three on less than twenty million dollars of this thrift 's senior subordinated notes
The rating concern said Franklin 's troubled diversification record in the securities business was one reason for the downgrade citing the troubles at its L. F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries
They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these said Franklin President Duane H. Hall
I think it was a little premature on their part
Just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks Wall Street suffered another severe attack of nerves
Does this signal another Black Monday is coming
Or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity just like October nineteenth nineteen eighty seven eventually turned out to be
Here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about Friday 's action what happens next and what investors should do
Joseph Granville
I 'm the only one who said there would be an October massacre all through late August and September says Mr. Granville once a widely followed market guru and still a well known newsletter writer
Everyone will tell you that this time is different from nineteen eighty seven he says
Well in some ways it is different but technically it is just the same
If you 're a technician you obey the signals
Right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out
I see no major support until two thousand two hundred
I see a possibility of going to two thousand two hundred this month
Mr. Granville says he would n't even think of buying until at least six hundred to seven hundred stocks have hit fifty two week lows about one hundred stocks hit new lows Friday
Most people he says have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like
Elaine Garzarelli
A quantitative analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated Ms. Garzarelli had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the nineteen eighty seven crash
Friday 's big drop she says was not a crash
This was an October massacre like those that occurred in nineteen seventy eight and nineteen seventy nine
Now as in those two years her stock market indicators are positive
So she thinks the damage will be short lived and contained
Those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market ten percent twelve percent down she says
This is exactly the same thing as far as I 'm concerned
Thus she says if the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below two thousand four hundred fifty It would just be a fluke
My advice is to buy
As she calculates it the average stock now sells for about twelve point five times companies ' earnings
She says that ratio could climb to fourteen point five given current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value
Ned Davis
Friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market says Mr. Davis president of Ned Davis Research Incorporated
But Mr. Davis whose views are widely respected by money managers says he expects no nineteen eighty seven style crash
There was a unique combination in nineteen eighty seven he says
Margin debt was at a record high
There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds
The main thing was portfolio insurance a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses
A hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it
In nineteen eighty seven such selling contributed to a snowball effect
Today could even be an up day Mr. Davis says if major brokerage firms agree to refrain from program trading
Over the next several months though he says things look bad
I think the market will be heading down into November he says
We will probably have a year end rally and then go down again
Sort of a two step bear market
He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around two thousand oh sometime next year
That would be a normal bear market he says
I guess that 's my forecast
Leon G. Cooperman
I do n't think the market is going through another October eighty seven
I do n't think that 's the case at all says Mr. Cooperman a partner at Goldman Sachs & Company and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Mr. Cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains but he does n't think there 's any need to rush
I expect the market to open weaker Monday but then it should find some stability
He ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago
Unlike nineteen eighty seven interest rates have been falling this year
Unlike nineteen eighty seven the dollar has been strong
And unlike nineteen eighty seven the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of overheating
But the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is n't good he says
So it 's a very mixed bag
Thus he concludes This is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks
If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios I would not do any buying
But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio so I would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients
We 're going to look for some of the better known companies that got clocked Friday
John Kenneth Galbraith
This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity says Mr. Galbraith an economist
I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he says
This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable
Nevertheless he says a depression does n't appear likely
There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose he says
It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the Thirties much as the financial community and the government may try
Mario Gabelli
New York money manager Mario Gabelli an expert at spotting takeover candidates says that takeovers are n't totally gone
Companies are still going to buy companies around the world he says
Examples are Ford looking at Jaguar BellSouth looking at LIN Broadcasting
These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue
The market was up thirty five percent since President Bush took office Mr. Gabelli says so a correction was to be expected
He thinks another crash is unlikely and says he was nibbling at selected stocks during Friday 's plunge
Stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week for guys like me he says
Jim Rogers
He sees economic problems financial problems ahead for the U. S. with a fairly strong possibility of a recession
Friday you could n't sell dollars he says
Dealers would give you a quote but then refuse to make the trade
If the dollar stays weak he says that will add to inflationary pressures in the U. S. and make it hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much
Mr. Rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go
He recommends that investors sell takeover related stocks but hang on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do well during periods of economic weakness
Frank Curzio
Many people now claim to have predicted the nineteen eighty seven crash
Queens newsletter writer Francis X. Curzio actually did it He stated in writing in September nineteen eighty seven that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to decline about five hundred points the following month
Mr. Curzio says what happens now will depend a good deal on the Federal Reserve Board
If it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks he says That could quiet things down
If not We could go to two thousand two hundred very soon
Frank W. Terrizzi
Stock prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says Mr. Terrizzi president and managing director of Renaissance Investment Management Incorporated in Cincinnati
Renaissance which manages about one point eight billion dollars drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally
Renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents primarily U. S. Treasury bills
T. bills probably are the right place to be he says
Regarding the October third letter to the editor from Representative Tom Lantos chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing alleging
one That your September twenty eighth editorial Kangaroo Committees was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading
I thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative
two That Mr. Lantos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the Fifth Amendment
Yes he did
As I watched him on C. Span I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings
He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution
He used about fifty six words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights
Unfortunately by my rough guess he used better than five thousand words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the Fifth
He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary
As your editorial rightly pointed out Samuel Pierce former HUD secretary and Lance Wilson Mr. Pierce 's former aide are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment
That certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by Mr. Lantos
three That his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at HUD
My colleagues and I fully realize we are not a court etc
Absolute rubbish
By any reasonable man criterion Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted
Apparently their verdict is in
Right now they 're pursuing evidence
That 's not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard American practice
How was that practice referred to when I was in school
Ah yes something called a Star Chamber
Of course Mr. Lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change
No doubt that 's partially true
Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true
He 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior HUD officials
But if his explanation of motivation is true why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity
Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency
Such as what happened when Congress wanted to know about four hundred dollars toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost
No Mr. Lantos 's complaints simply wo n't wash
four That the Journal defends the sleaze fraud waste embezzlement influence peddling and abuse of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD et cetera and so forth
No to my mind the Journal did not defend sleaze fraud waste embezzlement influence peddling and abuse of the public trust
it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense
Of course we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective
The system is the problem not an individual member
Individuals can always have their hands slapped
It 's when such slapping does n't occur that we 've got trouble
I do not by any means defend HUD management
But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency and yes maybe criminality within HUD could possibly generate
The last time I saw a similar congressional hearing was when Tail Gunner Joe McCarthy did his work
Raymond Weber
Parsippany N. J.
I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination in congressional hearings
The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
This privilege against self incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify
Thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the Fifth
The privilege however has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause
Baxter v. Palmingiano four hundred twenty five U. S. three hundred eight nineteen seventy six
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution
Absent the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify
The subcommittee Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime
Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self incrimination

It was Friday the thirteenth and the stock market plummeted nearly two hundred points
Just a coincidence
Or is triskaidekaphobia fear of the number thirteen justified
In academia a so called Friday the thirteenth effect has been set up and shot down by different professors
Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez professors of finance at the University of Miami found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the thirteenth
But their study which spanned the nineteen sixty two eighty five period has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data
In the seventies the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the you know what
But the date tends to be a plus not a minus for stocks according to Yale Hirsch a collector of stock market lore
Another study found that the eighty two Fridays the thirteenth in the nineteen forty nineteen eighty seven period had higher than average returns higher even than Fridays in general which tend to be strong days for stock prices
On the only other Friday the thirteenth this year the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points
Professor Kolb says the original study titled Friday the thirteenth Part Seven was published tongue in cheek
In a similar vein he adds that the anniversary of the nineteen eighty seven crash and Saturday 's full moon could have played a part too in Friday 's market activity
reminiscent of those during the nineteen eighty seven crash that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated some phone calls to market makers in over the counter stocks went unanswered
We could n't get dealers to answer their phones said Robert King senior vice president of O. T. C. trading at Robinson Humphrey Company in Atlanta
It was like the Friday before Black Monday two years ago
Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the New York and American exchanges
Nonetheless the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever diving fourteen point nine zero or three percent to four hundred sixty seven point two nine
Ten points of the drop occurred during the last forty five minutes of trading
By comparison the New York Stock Exchange Composite tumbled five point eight percent Friday and the American Stock Exchange Composite fell four percent
On October sixteenth nineteen eighty seven the Nasdaq Composite fell sixteen point one eight points or three point eight percent followed by its devastating forty six point one two point or eleven percent slide three days later
Nasdaq volume Friday totaled one hundred sixty seven point seven million shares which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year
The single day record of two hundred eighty eight million shares was set on October twenty first
Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors
Mr. King of Robinson Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades
The subject is a sore one for Nasdaq and its market making companies which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash
Peter DaPuzzo head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton declared It was the last hour of trading on a Friday
There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots
It was n't intentional we were all busy
James Tarantino head of O. T. C. trading at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco said It was just like two years ago
Everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time
Jeremiah Mullins the O. T. C. trading chief at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York said proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading
But he added you can only take one call at a time
Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur
On days like Friday that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to
When selling is so frenzied prices fall steeply and fast
Two years ago faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories market makers themselves began dumping shares exacerbating the slide in O. T. C. stock prices
On Friday some market makers were selling again traders said
But with profits sagging on Wall Street since the crash companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand
Mr. Tarantino of Hambrecht & Quist said some prices fell without trades taking place as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares
Everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid he said
So while O. T. C. companies incurred losses on Friday trading officials said the damage was n't as bad as it was in nineteen eighty seven
Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit
I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now said Mr. King of Robinson Humphrey
Tony Cecin head of equity trading at Piper Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis said that Piper Jaffray actually made money on Friday
It helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago he said
Joseph Hardiman president of the National Association of Securities Dealers which oversees the Nasdaq computerized trading system said that despite the rush of selling he never considered the situation an emergency
The pace of trading was orderly he said
Nasdaq 's Small Order Execution System worked beautifully as did the automated system for larger trades according to Mr. Hardiman
Nevertheless the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence
In the past the O. T. C. market thrived on a firm base of small investor participation
Because Nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to pre crash levels traders and O. T. C. market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent
But they are worried
We were just starting to get the public 's confidence back lamented Mr. Mullins of Dean Witter
Mr. Cecin of Piper Jaffray says some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears
It wo n't take much more to scare the hell out of retail investors he says
The sellers on Friday came from all corners of the O. T. C. market big and small institutional investors as well as individual investors and market makers
But grateful traders said the sell orders generally ranged from twenty thousand shares to fifty thousand shares compared with blocks of five hundred thousand shares or more two years ago
Shearson 's Mr. DaPuzzo said retail investors nervously sold stock Friday and never returned to bargain hunt
Institutional investors which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter were calmer
We had a good amount of selling from institutions but not as much panic Mr. DaPuzzo said
If they could n't sell some of them put the shares back on the shelf
In addition he said some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some O. T. C. stocks whose prices were beaten down
Nasdaq 's biggest stocks were hammered
The Nasdaq one hundred Index of the largest nonfinancial issues including the big O. T. C. technology issues tumbled four point two percent or nineteen point seven six to four hundred forty nine point three three
The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped two percent or nine point three one to four hundred sixty two point nine eight
The O. T. C. market has only a handful of takeover related stocks
But they fell sharply
McCaw Cellular Communications for instance has offered to buy LIN Broadcasting as well as Metromedia 's New York City cellular telephone interests and in a separate transaction sell certain McCaw properties to Contel Cellular
McCaw lost eight percent or three and a half to forty
LIN Broadcasting dropped five and a half or five percent to one hundred seven and a half
The turnover in both issues was roughly normal
Commercial Intertech plummeted six to twenty six
The issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled Friday
On the O. T. C. market First Executive a big buyer of the high risk high yield issues slid two to twelve and a quarter

Pension funds insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during Friday 's market rout
And they plan to buy more today
Rightly or wrongly many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the October nineteen eighty seven crash Buying at the bottom pays off
To be sure big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today
They could still panic and bail out of the market
But their nineteen eighty seven performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse
Last time we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst said John W. Rogers president of Chicago based Ariel Capital Management Incorporated which manages one point one billion dollars of stocks
Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for our favorite stocks that have fallen apart
He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further
Denver based portfolio manager James Craig was n't daunted when Friday 's rout shaved forty million dollars from the value of the seven hundred fifty two million dollars Janus Fund he oversees
I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through he said
Then he jumped into the market
I spent thirty million dollars in the last half hour
Other money managers also opened their wallets
I was buying at the close Friday and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value said Frederick A. Moran president of Moran Asset Management Incorporated Greenwich Conn
There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash
Unlike mutual funds which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock
Most often they do just that because stocks have proved to be the best performing long term investment attracting about one trillion dollars from pension funds alone
If you bought after the crash you did very very well off the bottom said Stephen B. Timbers chief investment officer of Chicago based Kemper Financial Services Incorporated
The fifty six billion dollars California Public Employees Retirement System for one added one billion dollars to its stock portfolio two years ago
Those that pulled out of stocks regretted it he said so I doubt you 'll see any significant changes in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday 's decline
Stocks as measured by the Standard & Poor 's five hundred stock index have been stellar performers this year rising twenty seven point nine seven percent before Friday 's plunge excluding dividends
Even Friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than twenty percent well above the annual average for stocks over several decades
You could go down four hundred points and still have a good year in the market said James D. Awad president of New York based B. M. I. Capital Corporation
Mr. Awad however worries that the market could go down eight hundred or nine hundred points in the next few days
It can happen before you can turn around
He said he discerns many parallels with nineteen eighty seven including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re emergence of computerized program trading
The only thing you do n't have he said is the portfolio insurance phenomenon overlaid on the rest
Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique which is widely thought to have worsened the nineteen eighty seven crash
Not really insurance this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S. & P. futures contracts
In its severest test the sixty billion dollars of portfolio insurance in effect in the nineteen eighty seven crash did n't work as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected
Even without portfolio insurance market conditions were grim Friday money managers said
We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything said Mr. Weisman who happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier declined the offers
Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again trapping more investors
I think it will be a rigor mortis rally he said
Meanwhile Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally
Especially gleeful were the short sellers who have been pounded by this year 's market climb
The shorts sell borrowed shares hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price
The nation 's largest short selling operation is Feshbach Brothers Palo Alto California which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of ten percent for the year up to that point
All that now has changed
We 're ahead for the year because of Friday said the firm 's Kurt Feshbach
We 're not making a killing but we had a good day
Food and Drug Administration spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Incorporated to the U. S. Attorney 's office in Baltimore
Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens N. Y. company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes
Vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham P. L. C. product as its own in tests
Mr. Nesbit also said the F. D. A. has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Company to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic
But so far the company has n't complied with that request the spokesman said
Bolar of Copiague N. Y. earlier began a voluntary recall of both its one hundred milligram and fifty milligram versions of the drug
The F. D. A. has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin
Bolar has denied that it switched the brand name product for its own in such testing
The West German retailer A. S. K. O. Deutsche Kaufhaus A. G. plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands
Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged though unsuccessfully A. S. K. O. 's Dutch lawyers noted
Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense A. S. K. O. will then ask the court to overturn such a vote diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold N. V.
A. S. K. O. says the Dutch based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of A. S. K. O. and other shareholders
Speaking through its Dutch lawyers A. S. K. O. also disclosed it holds a fifteen percent stake in Ahold
It was previously thought A. S. K. O. held a thirteen point six percent stake that was accumulated since July
A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred share issue
He termed A. S. K. O. 's legal actions as unproductive to international cooperation among European retailers
Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman Willard Butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President Bush 's economic policy making
There are some very significant issues out there such as the fiscal deficit the trade deficit our relations with Japan that have to be the subject of major initiatives he said in an interview
I 'd like to see that initiative and I have n't
There is n't a big shot an agenda
A few hours later the stock market dropped one hundred ninety points
Politicians tried to finger each other for the blame although many analysts doubt that Washington was singly responsible for Wall Street 's woes
But Mr. Butcher 's comments make one thing clear Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy
Consider this
By eleven fifty nine p. m. tonight President Bush must order sixteen billion dollars of automatic across the board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm Rudman budget law
The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit cutting bill
We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta D. Calif said yesterday on N. B. C. News 's Meet the Press
For the last two weeks the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi public battle over international economic policy
The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower the Fed has been resisting
One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board said Lawrence Kudlow a Bear Stearns & Company economist on A. B. C. 's This Week
The administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers
Last month Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner forced Northwest Airlines to reduce a stake held by K. L. M. Royal Dutch Airlines
But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision
And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines which includes a big stake by British Airways P. L. C.
Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington 's anti takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through the event that triggered the market drop
In many ways the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October nineteen eighty seven 's five hundred eight point crash
Then as now the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold
The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve
And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers then by the tax writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department were making markets nervous
But barring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year
One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that as everyone learned in nineteen eighty seven the economy and the market can survive a one day five hundred eight point tumble
Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of nineteen twenty nine that we were looking at a recession Representative Panetta said yesterday in an interview
That did not happen
They learned they could survive it without much problem
But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta who said a precipitous drop this week is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy
In that case there will be plenty of blame to go around
Nevertheless it clearly will take more than Friday 's one hundred ninety point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital gains fight
Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit reduction legislation
During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit cutting bill and the capital gains issue there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds
At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit reduction legislation White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it
When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation Oregon Senator Bob Packwood the ranking G. O. P. member of the tax writing Senate Finance Committee hailed it
Asked if the administration agreed he curtly replied The adminstration will have to speak for itself
Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit reduction measure a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest
Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal nineteen ninety deficit
Representative Panetta said that O. M. B. 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across the board cuts but added We 're getting very close to the margins here
No one in Washington was willing to take the blame for provoking Friday 's drop in the stock market
But some players were quick to seize the moment
Investors who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell were spooked he said
There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital gains tax cut Senator Mitchell said during his television appearance but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others

Small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market
I 'm not losing faith in the market said Boston lawyer Christopher Sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm
But he 's not so sure about everyone else
I think on Monday the small investors are going to panic and sell predicted Mr. Sullivan whose investments include A. M. R. Corporation 's American Airlines unit and several mutual funds
And I think institutions are going to come in and buy
I 'm going to hold on
If I sell now I 'll take a big loss
Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they did n't flee the market in nineteen eighty seven
Oh I bet it 'll be up fifty points on Monday said Lucy Crump a seventy eight year old retired housewife in Lexington Ky
Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club 's portfolio lost about one third of its value following the Black Monday crash but no one got discouraged and we gained that back and more
At the annual congress of the National Association of Investors Corporation at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Minneapolis the scene was calm
Some five hundred investors representing investor clubs from around the U. S. were attending when the market started to slide Friday
But Robert Showalter an official of the association said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned
In fact some of the association 's members long term buy and hold investors welcomed the drop in prices
We hope to take advantage of it said John Snyder a member of a Los Angeles investors ' club
He has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants
Marc Perkins a Tampa Florida investment banker said the market drop is one of a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take out era is ending
There 's no question that there 's a general distaste for leverage among lenders
Mr. Perkins believes however that the market could be stabilized if California investor Marvin Davis steps back in to the United bidding with an offer of two hundred seventy five dollars a share
Sara Albert a thirty four year old Dallas law student says she 's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it
I have this feeling that it 's built on sand she says that the market rises but there 's no foundation to it
She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the nineteen eighty seven crash although she still owns some Texaco stock
Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid
Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand
We all assumed October eighty seven was a one time shot said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg
We told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime come on back
Now it 's happening again
Mr. Greenberg got out just before the nineteen eighty seven crash and to his regret never went back even as the market soared
This time he 's ready to buy in when the panic wears off
Still he adds We ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often
When the little guy gets frightened the big guys hurt badly
Merrill Lynch ca n't survive without the little guy
Small investors have tiptoed back into the market following Black Monday but mostly through mutual funds
Discount brokerage customers have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago says Leslie Quick Junior chairman of the Quick & Reilly discount brokerage firm
Hugo Quackenbush senior vice president at Charles Scwhab Corporation says Schwab customers have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks
Individual investors are still angry about program trading Mr. Quackenbush says
Avner Arbel a Cornell University finance professor says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to win back the confidence of the small investor
But it 's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried
Alan Helfman general sales manager of a Chrysler dealership in Houston said he and his mother have some joint stock investments but the overall economy is his chief worry
These high rollers took a big bath today he said in his showroom which is within a few miles of the multi million dollar homes of some of Houston 's richest citizens
And I can tell you that a high roller is n't going to come in tomorrow and buy a Chrysler T. C. by Maserati
And finally there were the gloaters
I got out in nineteen eighty seven
Everything said Pascal Antori an Akron Ohio plumbing contractor who was visiting Chicago and stopped by Fidelity Investments ' LaSalle Street office
I just stopped by to see how much I would have lost
Would Mr. Antori ever get back in
Are you kidding
When it comes to money Once bitten two thousand times shy
The crowded field for notebook sized computers is about to become a lot more crowded
Compaq Computer Corporation 's long awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market especially Zenith Electronics Corporation the current market leader and on a swarm of promising start ups
Compaq 's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market
One manufacturer already has produced a clipboard sized computer called a notepad and two others have introduced even smaller palmtops
But those machines are still considered novelties with keyboards only a munchkin could love and screens to match
Compaq 's notebooks by contrast may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines
Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market and they 're priced aggressively at two thousand four hundred dollars to five thousand dollars
All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases
In recent months Compaq 's competition including Zenith Toshiba Corporation Tandy Corporation and N. E. C. Corporation all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks perhaps misleadingly
One analyst noting that most such machines are about two inches thick takes exception to the name
This is n't quite a notebook I call it a phonebook he says
That ca n't be said of the two thousand four hundred dollars notepad computer introduced a few weeks ago by GRiD Systems Corporation a unit of Tandy
Instead of a keyboard it features a writing surface an electronic pen and the ability to read block printing
At four and a half pounds it may be too ambitiously named but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth
Palmtops are n't far behind
Some critics however say its ability to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory
Poquet Computer Corporation meanwhile has introduced a much more sophisticated palmtop that can run Lotus one two three and other sophisticated software programs but costs five times as much
At stake is what Mike Swavely Compaq 's president of North America operations calls the Holy Grail of the computer industry the search for a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere
The market is so new nobody knows yet how big it can be
I 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is says Tom Humphries director of marketing for GRiD
Whether it 's five billion dollars or three point five billion dollars it does n't matter
It 's huge
Consider the growth of portables which now comprise twelve percent of all personal computer sales
Laptops generally anything under fifteen pounds have become the fastest growing personal computer segment with sales doubling this year
Responding to that demand however has led to a variety of compromises
Making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory
It also has precluded use of the faster more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines
Size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays
The competitive sniping can get pretty petty at times
A Poquet spokesman for example criticizes the Atari Portfolio because it requires three batteries while the Poquet needs only two
Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers who argue that they 're too small a problem Poquet also encountered in focus groups admits Gerry Purdy director of marketing
Poquet trying to avoid the gadget label responded with the tag line The Poquet P. C. a Very Big Computer
Despite the sniping few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that do n't make compromises
Toward that end experts say the real battle will take place between center stage players like Toshiba Zenith and now Compaq
But the Dynabook product is twice as heavy and costs more than Compaq 's
Zenith holders will vote in December on the proposed six hundred thirty five million dollars sale a price that could slip because it is pegged to Zenith 's share and sales
Compaq is already taking aim at Zenith 's market share
Rod Canion Compaq 's president and chief executive officer notes pointedly that Zenith 's two thousand dollars MinisPort uses an unconventional two inch floppy disk whereas Compaq 's new machines use the more common three one two inch disk
John P. Frank president of Zenith Data Systems simply shrugs off such criticism noting that three one two inch floppies were also unconventional when they first replaced five inch disks
We do n't look at it as not being a standard we look at it as a new standard he argues
Analysts do n't see it that way
I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else says Gene Talsky president of Professional Marketing Management Incorporated
Adds Bill Lempesis senior industry analyst for DataQuest a high technology market research firm We basically think that these are very hot products
The problem Compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them
Others undoubtedly will follow but most analysts believe Compaq has at least a six month lead on the competition
A third model marketed in Japan may hit the U. S. by the end of the first quarter of nineteen ninety but by then analysts say Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players
What about Big Blue
International Business Machines Corporation analysts say has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into notebooks anytime soon
Honeywell Incorporated and International Business Machines Corporation received Air Force contracts to develop integrated circuits for use in space
Honeywell 's contract totaled sixty nine point seven million dollars and I. B. M. 's sixty eight point eight million dollars
Boeing Company received a forty six point seven million dollars Air Force contract for developing cable systems for the Minuteman Missile
General Dynamics Corporation received a twenty nine million dollars Air Force contract for electronic warfare training sets
Grumman Corporation received an eighteen point one million dollars Navy contract to upgrade aircraft electronics
Avco Corporation received an eleven point eight million dollars Army contract for helicopter engines
The monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years
The index which registered one hundred fifty six point eight at the end of September has a base of one hundred set in nineteen eighty three and is n't seasonally adjusted
Japan 's wholesale prices in September rose three point three percent from a year earlier and were up zero point four percent from the previous month the Bank of Japan announced Friday
The wholesale price index stood at ninety point one compared with a nineteen eighty five base of one hundred
Plunge
What plunge
Twenty four New York Stock Exchange issues hit fifty two week highs during Friday 's trading despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average 's one hundred ninety point five eight point plunge
Stocks of utilities held up relatively better than other market sectors during the sell off
And among the issues hitting new highs were Detroit Edison Company and Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation
Other major issues hitting highs included American Telephone & Telegraph Company Westinghouse Electric Corporation Exxon Corporation and Cigna Corporation the big insurer
Of course many more issues ninety three hit new lows
These included International Business Machines Corporation which during Friday 's session traded below one hundred dollars a share for the first time since June nineteen eighty four
I. B. M. closed at one hundred two dollars down five point six two five dollars
Other new lows included Navistar International Corporation Union Carbide Corporation and Bethlehem Steel Corporation all of which are included in the industrial average
Meanwhile two initial public offerings braved the cascading market in their maiden day of national over the counter trading Friday
Ford Motor Company said it acquired five percent of the shares in Jaguar P. L. C.
Jaguar the London Stock Exchange and the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified of the transactions the company said
The U. S. Federal Trade Commission advised Ford last week that it would n't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as fifteen percent of Jaguar shares
The Number two auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as fifteen percent of the British luxury car maker the maximum allowed under current United Kingdom government restrictions
General Motors Corporation said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began buying shares
G. M. said it still is talking with Jaguar about acquiring a minority interest
Investors who bought stock with borrowed money that is on margin may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop
That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans
In October nineteen eighty seven these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market
Typically a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below seventy five percent of its original value
If the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities
But some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls
Margin calls since Friday have been higher than usual but reasonable a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated said
Merrill Lynch & Company officials do n't expect margin calls to be as big a factor as in nineteen eighty seven because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin a spokesman said
Hugo Quackenbush senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corporation the San Francisco based discount brokerage firm said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers
He said Schwab had increased margin requirements so customers have more of a cushion
He added We learned a lesson in nineteen eighty seven about volatility
Avis Incorporated following rival Hertz Corporation 's lead said it is backing out of frequent flier programs with three airlines
But it remains involved in programs with A. M. R. Corporation 's American Airlines unit and Delta Air Lines
Industry estimates put Avis 's annual cost of all five programs at between eight million and fourteen million dollars
A spokesman for Avis would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for far less than half of the total
Budget Rent a Car Corporation of Chicago and National Car Rental Systems Incorporated of Minneapolis both said they had no plans to follow suit
In fact Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs in which renters earn frequent flier miles and fliers can get car rental discounts
I can not see how this news by Hertz and Avis can not benefit Budget 's programs said Bob Wilson Budget 's vice president marketing planning
Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements
National also participates in the Northwest frequent flier program along with four other airlines including Delta and U. S. Air Group Incorporated 's U. S. Air unit
At the time Hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to twenty million dollars and that the value of redeemed awards topped fifteen million dollars
Analysts and competitors however doubt the numbers were that high
Budget said its frequent flier costs are substantially below Avis 's level
Robert D. Cardillo Avis vice president of marketing said The proliferation and costs attached to frequent flier programs have significantly diminished their value
This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis said Charles Finnie car rental industry analyst at Alex Brown & Sons
They 've been looking to get their costs down and this is a fairly sensible way to do it he said
C. B. S. Incorporated is cutting The Pat Sajak Show down to one hour from its current ninety minutes
C. B. S. insisted the move was n't a setback for the program which is the network 's first entry into the late night talk show format since nineteen seventy two
I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it said Rod Perth who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August
This will raise the energy level of the show
C. B. S. will continue to program action adventure shows to follow the Sajak hour
But C. B. S. News will extend its four hour Nightwatch by thirty minutes and begin at one thirty a.m
Further fractioning the late night audience is the addition of the Arsenio Hall Show syndicated by Paramount Communications Incorporated
Tandem Computers Incorporated preparing to fight with International Business Machines Corporation for a piece of the mainframe business said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended September thirtieth
Tandem said it expects to report revenue of about four hundred fifty million dollars and earnings of thirty five cents to forty cents a share
The results which are in line with analysts ' estimates reflect a continued improvement in our U. S. business said James Treybig Tandem 's chief executive officer
In the year earlier period Tandem reported net income of thirty point one million dollars or thirty one cents a share on revenue of three hundred eighty three point nine million dollars
Tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week
Analysts have predicted that the Cupertino California company will report revenue of four hundred thirty million to four hundred sixty million dollars and earnings of thirty five cents to forty cents a share
Commenting on the results for the quarter Mr. Treybig said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as a surprise to him noting that sales in every region of the U. S. exceeded our plan
The company 's U. S. performance was helped by a record quarter for new customers he said
Tandem makes fault tolerant computers machines with built in backup systems that run stock exchanges networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems
Tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers
Tandem 's new high end computer is called Cyclone
Prices for the machine which can come in various configurations are two million to ten million dollars
Analysts expect the new computer to wrest a hefty slice of business away from I. B. M. the longtime leader in mainframes
We believe they could siphon perhaps two to three billion dollars from I. B. M. over the next few years said George Weiss an analyst at the Gartner group
That will spur Tandem 's growth
I 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than twenty percent next year said John Levinson an analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co
I. B. M. is expected to respond to Tandem 's Cyclone by discounting its own mainframes which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from Tandem
Obviously I. B. M. can give bigger discounts to users immediately said Mr. Weiss
But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue 's machines
The answer is n't price reductions but new systems he said
Nevertheless Tandem faces a variety of challenges the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as complementary to I. B. M. 's mainframes
Even Mr. Treybig is reluctant to abandon this notion insisting that Tandem 's new machines are n't replacements for I. B. M. 's mainframes
We 're after a little bigger niche he said
Do n't jump yet
The stock market 's swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy
In one wild hour of trading the market managed to accomplish what the Bush administration has been trying to do unsuccessfully for weeks
It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar
The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate American business indeed the entire economy
This may sound strangely optimistic
After all until a few years ago the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy
When it went down by all tradition the economy followed
That has changed partly because the two years following the worst stock market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable
The nineteen eighty seven crash was a false alarm however you view it says University of Chicago economist Victor Zarnowitz
The market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation
Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy
The market today has a life of its own John Akers chairman of International Business Machines Corporation said Saturday
There 's nothing rational about this kind of action
Of course the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week
Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U. S. now relies for financial sustenance
The financial services industry was battered by the nineteen eighty seven crash
What 's more although the stock market is far less overvalued today than two years ago the U. S. economy is weaker
Growth is slower
Profits are softer
Debt burdens are heavier
But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate
The Fed which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets
Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest rate policies
But the experience of the nineteen eighty seven crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short term interest rates in its effort to calm markets
Anticipating the Fed 's move money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to eight point six two five percent late Friday down from eight point eight two zero percent the day before
Tiny movements in the rate which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves on the monetary markets
The dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the U. S.
Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years
The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar
A modest drop in the dollar only a modest one mind you would be welcomed by the U. S.
Another big difference between nineteen eighty seven and nineteen eighty nine is n't so comforting
In the third quarter of nineteen eighty seven the economy spurted at an inflation adjusted annual rate of five point three percent
The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish two point three percent in the third quarter of nineteen eighty nine which ended two weeks ago
The plunge in stock prices is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down says economist Lawrence Chimerine of W. E. F. A. Group a Bala Cynwyd Pennsylvania forecasting company
A lot of pent up demand is gone
Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday nineteen eighty seven but only slightly and for a short period of time recalls Mr. Zarnowitz a longtime student of business cycles
That was offset by strength elsewhere
The effects were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected
Today he frets exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers retrench in reaction
What 's more the corporate borrowing binge has n't abated in the past two years
We 've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt just at the time when earnings are being squeezed Mr. Chimerine notes
The more a company relies on borrowed money the greater its sensitivity to an economic slowdown
A company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court
The Fed of course knows that very well hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy this morning
But in the process the Fed risks reigniting inflation
The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession he reasons it 's an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation
In the end the nineteen eighty seven collapse suggested the economy does n't move in lockstep with stock prices
The economy does however depend on the confidence of businesses consumers and foreign investors
A panic on Wall Street does n't exactly inspire confidence
Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday
A one hundred ninety point drop is n't likely to make much of a dent multiply that a few times over though and it will
If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at Hot Springs Virginia for the Business Council meetings are typical business leaders were n't overly rattled by Friday 's decline
And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious well the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the U. S. can stand it
On the bottom line the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before
Two years ago about the only point of comparison was the nineteen twenty nine crash and the subsequent Depression
The doomsayers had a receptive audience
The prosperity that followed Black Monday permits a more optimistic view today
At the very least the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last go around
As Senator Lloyd Bentsen D. Texas observed yesterday The Fed avoided a meltdown last time
They are more sophisticated this time
The chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of skidding prices in the commodity end of the business
Producers of commodity chemicals the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers
Once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now fading boom these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the nineteen eighty eight third quarter
For some of these companies this will be the first quarter with year to year negative comparisons says Leonard Bogner a chemical industry analyst at Prudential Bache Research
This could be the first of five or six down quarters
Perhaps most prominent Dow Chemical Company which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier if only by a shade
Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals the company still has a big stake in polyethylene which is used in packaging and housewares
A Dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates
At the investment firm of Smith Barney Harris Upham & Company the commodity chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for twenty companies representative of the whole industry by eight percent to ten percent
You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better says James Wilbur a Smith Barney analyst
First Boston Corporation projects that ten of the fifteen companies it follows will report lower profit
Most of the ten have big commodity chemical operations
Still some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals
Du Pont Company is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigments fibers and polymers
Moreover the Wilmington Delaware company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs such as ethylene
Analysts are divided over whether Du Pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its Conoco Incorporated oil company
The estimates for Du Pont range from two point two five to two dollars and forty five cents a share
In the nineteen eighty eight third quarter the company earned four hundred sixty one million dollars or one dollar and ninety one cents a share on sales of seven point nine nine billion dollars
Du Pont declined to comment
Monsanto Company too is expected to continue reporting higher profit even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern Europe and the western U. S.
The Street Louis based company is expected to report again that losses in its G. D. Searle & Company pharmaceutical business are narrowing
Searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year but Monsanto has said it expects Searle to post a profit for all of nineteen eighty nine
Most estimates for Monsanto run between one point seven zero and two dollars a share
A year ago the company posted third quarter profit of one hundred sixteen million dollars or one dollar and sixty seven cents a share on sales of two point oh two billion dollars
Monsanto declined to comment
But the commodity chemical producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle
By some accounts on Wall Street and in the industry the inventory reductions are near an end which may presage firmer demand
But doubters say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early nineteen nineties
In the latest quarter at least profit is expected to fall sharply
For Himont Incorporated how far down it is we do n't know says Leslie Ravitz at Salomon Brothers
Himont faces lower prices for its mainstay product polypropylene while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for polypropylene whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries
The company based in Wilmington Delaware is eighty one percent owned by Montedison S.p A. Milan which has an offer outstanding for the Himont shares it does n't already own
At Quantum Chemical Corporation New York the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion
Some analysts hedge their estimates for Quantum because it is n't known when the company will book certain one time charges
But the estimates range from break even to thirty five cents a share
In the nineteen eighty eight third quarter Quantum earned ninety nine point eight million dollars or three dollars and ninety two cents a share on sales of seven hundred twenty four point four million dollars
Himont Quantum and Union Carbide all declined to comment

The interest only securities were priced at thirty five and a half to yield ten point seven two percent
There were no major Eurobond or foreign bond offerings in Europe Friday
The economy 's temperature will be taken from several vantage points this week with readings on trade output housing and inflation
The most troublesome report may be the August merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow
The trade gap is expected to widen to about nine billion dollars from July 's seven point six billion dollars according to a survey by M. M. S. International a unit of McGraw Hill Incorporated New York
Thursday 's report on the September consumer price index is expected to rise although not as sharply as the zero point nine percent gain reported Friday in the producer price index
That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in Friday 's session before it got started on its reckless one hundred ninety point plunge
Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization also due tomorrow
Meanwhile September housing starts due Wednesday are thought to have inched upward
There 's a possibility of a surprise in the trade report said Michael Englund director of research at M. M. S.
A widening of the deficit if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar would exacerbate trade problems but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted
In any event Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made
Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow he said
Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports economists said
Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations
The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences The forecasts run from a drop of zero point five percent to an increase of zero point four percent according to M. M. S.
A rebound in energy prices which helped push up the producer price index is expected to do the same in the consumer price report
The consensus view expects a zero point four percent increase in the September C. P. I. after a flat reading in August
Robert H. Chandross an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the C. P. I. than in prices at the producer level
Auto prices had a big effect in the P. P. I. and at the C. P. I. level they wo n't he said
Food prices are expected to be unchanged but energy costs jumped as much as four percent said Gary Ciminero economist at Fleet Norstar Financial Group
He also says he thinks core inflation which excludes the volatile food and energy prices was strong last month
He expects a gain of as much as zero point five percent in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases
Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from August 's annual pace of one million three hundred fifty thousand units
Economists say an August rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an increase in September starts though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards

Assuming the stock market does n't crash again and completely discredit yuppies and trading rooms American television audiences in a few months may be seeing Britain 's concept of both
Capital City is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer Thames Television
The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of nineteen eighty seven
Let 's make that nineteen twenty nine just to be sure
But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well pressure to pull off another million before lunch pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second
You need n't be a high powered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure
The slickly produced series has been criticized by London 's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ' professional and private lives
Turned loose in Shane Longman 's trading room the yuppie dealers do little right
Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes Shane Longman 's capital should be just about exhausted by the final thirteenth week
In the opening episode we learn that Michelle a junior bond trader has indeed pulled off another million before lunch
Trouble is she has lost it just as quickly
Rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone
Little chance that Shane Longman is going to recoup today
Traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds in the belief that the U. S. monthly trade figures will look lousy
Ah perfidious Columbia
The trade figures turn out well and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price
So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second
And a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays
Surprisingly Shane Longman survives the week only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation
Instead of closing ranks to protect the firm 's reputation the executive 's internal rivals led by a loutish American demand his resignation

Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class conscious Britain is n't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the Thatcherian free enterprise regime

This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of Max the trading room 's most flamboyant character
Yuppily enough he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church wears designer clothes and drives an antique car
But apparently to make him palatable even lovable to the masses the script inflates pony tailed Max into an eccentric genius master of eleven Chinese dialects
He takes his wash to the laundromat where he meets a punky French girl who dupes him into providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in Dieppe
In producing and promoting Capital City Thames has spent about as much as Shane Longman loses on a good day
Another half million quid went for a volley of full page advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway
These expenses create a special incentive for Capital City 's producers to flog it or a Yank oriented version of it in America
Thames 's U. S. marketing agent Donald Taffner is preparing to do just that
He is discreetly hopeful citing three U. S. comedy series Three 's Company Too Close for Comfort and Check It Out that had British antecedents
Perhaps without realizing it Mr. Taffner simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution Capital City should have been a comedy a worthy sequel to the screwball British Carry On movies of the nineteen sixties
The seeds already are in the script
The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading room crew minded a baby the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm
And many in the young cast bear striking resemblances to American T. V. and movie personalities known for light roles

Mr. Rustin is senior correspondent in the Journal 's London bureau
Axa Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed four point five billion dollars acquisition of Farmers Group Incorporated in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U. S. states where Farmers operates
The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B. A. T. Industries P. L. C. the British tobacco retailing paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles based Farmers
In an attempt to appease U. S. regulators ' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers Sir James in August agreed to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in acquiring B. A. T.
As part of the agreement Axa agreed to invest one billion dollars in Hoylake Investments Limited Sir James 's acquisition vehicle
The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais Societe Generale BankAmerica Corporation and Citicorp he said
Mr. Bebear said Axa Midi Group has more than two point five billion dollars of non strategic assets that we can and will sell to help pay off debt from the acquisition
He said the assets to be sold would be non insurance assets including a beer company and a real estate firm and would n't include any pieces of Farmers
We wo n't put any burden on Farmers he said
The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B. A. T.
We hope that with what we did the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake and they can directly look at the agreement with us because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime Mr. Bebear said
Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated
The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition
A spokesman for B. A. T. said of the amended filings that It would appear that nothing substantive has changed
The new financing structure is still a very highly leveraged one and Axa still plans to take out seventy five percent of Farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt
That dividend is almost double the thirty five percent currently taken out of Farmers by B. A. T. the spokesman added
It would have severe implications for Farmers ' policy holders
To fend off Sir James 's advances B. A. T. has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern
Dismal sales at General Motors Corporation dragged the U. S. car and truck market down below year ago levels in early October the first sales period of the nineteen ninety model year
The eight major domestic auto makers sold one hundred sixty thousand five hundred ten North American made cars in the first ten days of October a twelve point six percent drop from a year earlier
Domestically built truck sales were down ten point four percent to eighty six thousand five hundred fifty five pickups vans and sport utility vehicles
The heavy use of incentives to clear out nineteen eighty nine models appears to have taken the steam at least initially out of nineteen ninety model sales which began officially October first
This appears particularly true at G. M. which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall twenty six point three percent from last year 's unusually high level
Overall sales of all domestic made vehicles fell eleven point nine percent from a year ago
Without G. M. overall sales for the other U. S. automakers were roughly flat with nineteen eighty nine results
Some of the U. S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many nineteen ninety models but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up
We 've created a condition where without incentives it 's a tough market said Tom Kelly sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn Mich
Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of five point eight million vehicles the lowest since October nineteen eighty seven
The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month
Furthermore dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday 's steep market decline
G. M. 's domestic car sales dropped twenty four point three percent and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper twenty eight point seven percent from the same period a year ago
All of the G. M. divisions except Cadillac showed big declines
Cadillac posted a three point two percent increase despite new competition from Lexus the fledging luxury car division of Toyota Motor Corporation
Lexus sales were n't available the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at month end
Last year G. M. had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the nineteen eighty nine models had been sold
Aside from G. M. other car makers posted generally mixed results
Ford Motor Company had a one point eight percent drop in domestic car sales but a two point four percent increase in domestic truck sales
Chrysler Corporation had a seven point five percent drop in car sales echoing its generally slow performance all year
However sales of trucks including the company 's popular minivans rose four point three percent
Honda Motor Company 's sales of domestically built vehicles plunged twenty one point seven percent from a year earlier
Honda 's plant in Marysville Ohio was gearing up to build nineteen ninety model Accords a Honda spokesman said
We 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal he added
Separately Chrysler said firm prices on its nineteen ninety model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of five percent over comparably equipped nineteen eighty nine models
Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall
At that time Chrysler said base prices which are n't adjusted for equipment changes would rise between four percent and nine percent on most vehicle
a Totals include only vehicle sales reported in period
c Domestic car
d Percentage change is greater than nine hundred ninety nine percent
x There were eight selling days in the most recent period and eight a year earlier
Percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume

It was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the U. S. Congress and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency was accused by officials here of employing propagandists imperialists and spies
Now the network has opened a news bureau in the Hungarian capital
Employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign Szabad Europa Radio Radio Free Europe
I think this is a victory for the radio says Barnabas de Bueky a fifty five year old former Hungarian refugee who works in the Munich West Germany headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service
In fact the network hopes to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East Bloc that will have it
But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network 's life in more ways than one
In fact Radio Free Europe is in danger of suffering from its success
While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest so can others
In addition competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled
Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame even boring
They have a lot to do these days to compete with Hungarian radio says Andrew Deak a computer science student at the Technical University in Budapest
The Hungarian radio reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here
Indeed Hungary is in the midst of a media explosion
Boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe
Newsstands are packed with a colorful array of magazines
Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder
The British Broadcasting Corporation and the U. S. State Department 's Voice of America broadcast over Hungarian airwaves though only a few hours a day each in Hungarian
Australian press magnate Rupert Murdoch has bought fifty percent stakes in two popular and gossipy Hungarian newspapers while Britain 's Robert Maxwell has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves
But Radio Free Europe does n't plan to fade away
With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way the network 's staff says it still has plenty to do in Hungary and in the Great Eastern Beyond
Radio Free Europe and its sister station for the Soviet Union Radio Liberty say they wo n't cut back their more than nineteen hours of daily broadcasts
They are still an important source of news for sixty million listeners in twenty three exotic tongues from Bulgarian and Belorussian to Kazakh and Kirghiz
The establishment of its first bureau in Warsaw Pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in Eastern Europe
Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable
It proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission to set up office
That is a miracle
It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents who filed reports to the network by phone secret messengers or letters
During the past four years many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios says the writer
There were some very brave broadcasts
The listeners too had to be brave
Through much of the post World War Two period listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in Hungary
When we listen to the Europe station my mother still gets nervous says a Budapest translator
She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains
Now the toughest competition for Radio Free Europe comes during the late night slot
Hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight
Television which most of the time is considered rather tame has entered the running with a new program The End of the Day which comes on after eleven p.m
It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss Hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs
Those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on Sunday morning for Sunday Journal on Hungarian Radio
The competitive spirit is clearly influencing Radio Free Europe which is trying to beef up programs
The Budapest office plans to hire free lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in Hungarian country towns from Nagykanizsa in the west to Nyiregyhaza in the east
The Hungarian service has a daily forty minute news show called Newsreel with international and domestic news plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world
There 's also a host of new programs trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics
A daily thirty five minute program called The March of Time tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world
There 's a program for women and a science show
And to attract younger listeners Radio Free Europe intersperses the latest in Western rock groups
The Pet Shop Boys are big this year in Budapest
We are starving for all the news says Mr. Deak the student
Every moment we want to know everything about the world
Proposals for government operated national service like influenza flare up from time to time depress the resistance of the body politic run their course and seem to disappear only to mutate and afflict public life anew
The disease metaphor comes to mind of course not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service
Rather it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early nineteen seventies along with smallpox
It is back with us again in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a National and Community Service Act a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall
Why does the national service virus keep coming back
Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel
If only we could get America 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self discipline again and revive the spirit of giving
A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft by of all things expanding the draft
Choice of the volunteer military in the nineteen seventies seemed to doom national service as much as the draft
But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago when it again was let loose
This time it attempted to invade two connected problems the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans
Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants the advocates reasoned but require some form of service from each recipient
Military service moreover could be a national service option
Thus undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious infecting patriotic conservatives pay as you go moderates and idealistic liberals
The Democratic Leadership Council a centrist group sponsoring the plan surely thought it might help the party to attract support especially among college students and their parents
A provision allowing grants to be applied to first home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling
The D. L. C. plan envisaged volunteers planting trees emptying bedpans tutoring children and assisting librarians for one hundred dollars a week tax free plus medical care
With a tax free ten thousand dollars voucher payment at the end of each year the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to seventeen thousand five hundred dollars a year
Mind you most of the volunteers would be unskilled seventeen to eighteen year olds some not even high school graduates and many saving money by living at home
They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families
As it happened political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system so the national service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of give in order to get
Opposition to national service from the Pentagon which wants to protect its own recruitment process also led to the military service option being dropped
Clearly a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up
Before the menu is printed the House may add more ingredients also changing the initial price now posted at some three hundred thirty million dollars
It is widely known that too many cooks spoil the broth but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks especially if they are senators
The omnibus bill coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard
The aroma of patronage is in the air
Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance
On the contrary it is as robust as ever
According to the Gallup Poll American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service while financial contributions to charity in the nineteen eighties have risen thirty percent adjusted for inflation
Even if government does see various unmet needs national service is not the way to meet them
If we want to support students we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called scholarship rather than on the government 's idea of service
Or we might provide a tax credit for working students
What we do not need to do is start a war and then try to justify it by creating a G. I. Bill
Will national service in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted
Not necessarily
Polls show wide generalized support for some vague concept of service but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing
Nonetheless Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting associations societies and councils some of which may hope to receive the paid volunteers
There 's no need for such concessions
The omnibus can be defeated the virus controlled and real service protected
National service the utopian idea still wo n't go away then of course but the millions of knee socked youth performing works of civic content will be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors

American Physicians Service Group Incorporated said it purchased about forty two percent of Prime Medical Services Incorporated for about five million dollars from Texas American Energy Corporation
American Physicians said it also replaced four Texas American representatives on Prime 's five member board

Prime based in Bedminster N. J. provides management services to cardiac rehabilitation clinics and diagnostic imaging centers
For the year ended June thirtieth Prime had a net loss of three million dollars on sales of thirteen point eight million dollars
The state agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at one point three percent
If the economy continues to expand by zero point eight percent a quarter for the rest of the year it would leave G. D. P. growth for all of nineteen eighty nine at three percent the institute said
That would be down from the three point eight percent rise posted in nineteen eighty eight
The Canadian government announced a new twelve year Canada Savings Bond issue that will yield investors ten point five percent in the first year
The annual interest rate for each of the next eleven years will be set each fall when details of a new series are released
Canada Savings Bonds are major government instruments for meeting its financial requirements
The government has about forty one point four billion Canadian dollars thirty five point two billion U. S. dollars of such bonds currently outstanding
Only Canadian residents are permitted to buy Canada Savings Bonds which may be redeemed any time at face value
The bonds go on sale October nineteenth
The debate over National Service has begun again
After a decade in which more than fifty localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high school graduation the focus has shifted to Washington
At least ten bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring
One co sponsored by Senator Sam Nunn D. Ga and Representative Dave McCurdy D. Oklahoma would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served
It might well win Senate passage
President Bush has outlined his own Youth Entering Service YES plan though its details remain to be specified
What is one to think of all this
Doctrine and special interests govern some responses
People eager to have youth pay their dues to society favor service proposals preferably mandatory ones
So do those who seek a re energized concept of citizenship a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights
Then there are instinctive opponents
To libertarians mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money
Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform
If the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost
Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed they see service as a cover for the draft or fear the regimentation of youth or want to see rights enlarged not obligations
But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology
How should we think about national service
Let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning
Would service be voluntary or compulsory
Short or long
Part time or full time
Paid or unpaid
Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands
What kinds of work would they do
What does national mean
Would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations
And who would serve
Only males as with the draft or both sexes
Youth only or all ages
Middle class people or poor people or a genuine cross section
Many or few
Those are not trivial questions and the label national service answers none of them
Then how should we think about national service
As a starting point here are five propositions one Consider the ingredients not the name
Ignore national service in the abstract consider specific proposals
They will differ in crucial ways
two Service should be service
As commonly understood service implies sacrifice
It involves accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career
It follows that proposals like Nunn McCurdy whose benefits to enrollees are worth some seventeen thousand five hundred dollars a year do not qualify
There is a rationale for such bills Federal subsidies to college students amount to a G. I. Bill without the G. I. arguably those benefits should be earned not given
But the earnings exceed by twenty percent the average income of young high school graduates with full time jobs
Why call that service
three Encouragement is fine compulsion is not
Compelled service is unconstitutional
It is also unwise and unenforceable
Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year
But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior
It should also encourage service preferably by all classes and all ages
Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U. S. should build on the service programs already in existence and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing
four Good programs are not cheap
Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply forest fires fought housing rehabilitated students tutored day care centers staffed
There is important work to be done and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well but not cheaply
Good service programs require recruitment screening training and supervision all of high quality
They involve stipends to participants
Full time residential programs also require housing and full time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale
Non residential programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some ten thousand dollars a year
Are they worth that
Evaluations suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted
But the calculations are challengeable
five Underclass youth are a special concern
Are such expenditures worthwhile then
Yes if targeted
People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for middle class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost
They can volunteer at any of thousands of non profit institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers
Underclass youth do n't have those opportunities
They are not enrolled in high school or college
They are unlikely to be employed
And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by self destructive behaviors and bleak prospects
But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service
Some wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons
But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed
Learning skills producing something cooperatively feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them
Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune grass with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation
Strictly speaking these youth are not performing service
They are giving up no income deferring no careers incurring no risk
But they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future
That is a service to the nation
It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve
Mr. Szanton a Carter administration budget official heads his own Washington based strategic planning firm
He is a co author of National Service What Would It Mean
Lexington Books nineteen eighty six
Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet
And at the Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge
But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters
In addition officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout
The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis said one government official insisting on anonymity
Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories according to knowledgeable sources and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment
Nevertheless Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank 's game plan
It is prepared to assume the same role it played in October nineteen eighty seven providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat
The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions
The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on A. B. C. 's This Week
Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the S. E. C. and others have been in close contact
I 'm sure they 'll do what 's right what 's prudent what 's sensible he said
When it was suggested his comment was a non answer Mr. Darman replied It is a non answer
But in this context that 's the smart thing to do
At the Treasury Secretary Brady issued a statement minimizing the stock market 's drop
Today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy he said
The economy remains well balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth
But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week
One possibility is that this is a surgical setback reasonably limited in its breadth and not a major problem said one senior administration official who also asked that he not be named
The other is that we see another major disaster like two years ago
I think that 's less likely
Nevertheless Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world
Both the Treasury and the Fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments
In Tokyo share prices dropped sharply by one point seven percent in early Monday morning trading
After the initial slide the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower
In the Bush administration the lead is being taken by Treasury Secretary Brady Undersecretary Robert Glauber and Assistant Secretary Mullins
The three men worked together on the so called Brady Commission headed by Mr. Brady which was established after the nineteen eighty seven crash to examine the market 's collapse
As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets and financial market crises
Mr. Brady was at the White House Friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began
He was quickly on the phone with Mr. Mullins who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges
Later Mr. Brady phoned Mr. Greenspan S. E. C. Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in New York and overseas
Aides say he continued to work the phones through the weekend
Administration officials say President Bush was briefed throughout Friday afternoon and evening even after leaving for Camp David
He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. Brady and Michael Boskin chairman of the counsel of economic advisers
Government officials tried throughout the weekend to render a business as usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic
Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford for instance was at a meeting of the Business Council in Hot Springs Virginia when the stock market fell and remained there through the following day
And as of last night Fed Chairman Greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the American Bankers Association convention in Washington at ten a. m. this morning
Ironically Mr. Greenspan was scheduled to address the same convention in Dallas on October twentieth nineteen eighty seven
He flew to Dallas on October nineteenth when the market plummeted five hundred eight points but then turned around the next morning and returned to Washington without delivering his speech

Put down that phone
Walk around the room take two deep breaths
Resist the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks
That 's the advice of most investment professionals after Friday 's one hundred ninety point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
No one can say for sure what will happen today
And investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months
But they 're nearly unanimous on one point Do n't sell into a panic
Investors who sold everything after the crash of nineteen eighty seven lived to regret it
Even after Friday 's plunge the Dow Jones Industrial Average was forty eight percent above where it landed on October nineteenth two years ago
Panic selling also was unwise during other big declines in the past
The crash of nineteen twenty nine was followed by a substantial recovery before the great Depression and awful bear market of the nineteen thirties began
The October massacres of nineteen seventy eight and nineteen seventy nine were scary but did n't lead to severe or sustained downturns
Indeed some pros see Friday 's plunge plus any further damage that might occur early this week as a chance for bargain hunting
There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash says Stephen B. Timbers chief investment officer of Chicago based Kemper Financial Services Incorporated
But most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat
When you see a runaway train says Steve Janachowski partner in the San Francisco investment advisory firm Brouwer & Janachowski you wait for the train to stop
Even for people who expect a bear market in coming months and a sizable number of money managers and market pundits do the advice is Wait for the market to bounce back and sell shares gradually during rallies
On the one hand Mr. Front says it would be misguided to sell into a classic panic
On the other hand it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy
This is all emotion right now and when emotion starts to run it can run further than anyone anticipates he said
So it 's more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize
Roger Ibbotson professor of finance at Yale University and head of the market information firm Ibbotson Associates Incorporated says My real advice would be to just ride through it
Generally it is n't wise to be in and out of the stock market
Mr. Ibbotson thinks that this week is going to be a roller coaster week
But he also thinks it is a good week to consider buying
We 're dedicated long term investors not traders he says
We understand panics and euphoria
And we hope to take advantage of panics and buy stocks when they plunge
One camp of investment pros sees what happened Friday as an opportunity
Over the next days and weeks they say investors should look for stocks to buy
Friday 's action was an old fashioned panic says Alfred Goldman director of technical market analysis for A. G. Edwards & Sons in Street Louis
Stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price
His advice You ought to be there with a basket catching them
James Craig portfolio manager for the Denver based Janus Fund which has one of the industry 's better track records started his buying during Friday 's plunge
Stocks such as Hershey Foods Corporation Wal Mart Stores Incorporated American International Group Incorporated and Federal National Mortgage Association became such bargains that he could n't resist them he says
And Mr. Craig expects to pick up more shares today
It will be chaotic at first but I would not be buying if I thought we were headed for real trouble he says
He argues that stocks are reasonably valued now and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of nineteen eighty seven
Mr. Front of Stein Roe suggests that any buying should concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction
His firm favors selected computer drug and pollution control stocks
Other investment pros are more pessimistic
They say investors should sell stocks but not necessarily right away
Many of them stress that the selling can be orderly gradual and done when stock prices are rallying
On Thursday William Fleckenstein a Seattle money manager used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline
He thinks the underlying inflation rate is around five percent to six percent far higher than most people suppose
In the pension accounts he manages Mr. Fleckenstein has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks partly as an inflation hedge
He thinks government officials are terrified to let a recession start when government corporate and personal debt levels are so high
So he thinks the government will err on the side of rekindled inflation
As a result Mr. Fleckenstein says I think the ball game 's over and investors are about to face a bear market
David M. Jones vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company recommends Treasury securities of up to five years ' maturity
He says the October sixth employment report showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector is a warning sign to investors
One strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy put options either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index
A put option gives its holder the right but not the obligation to sell a stock or stock index for a specified price the strike price until the option expires
Whether this insurance is worthwhile depends on the cost of an option
The cost or premium tends to get fat in times of crisis
Thus buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk
The prices of puts generally did n't soar Friday
But put option prices may zoom when trading resumes today
It 's hard to generalize about a reasonable price for puts
But investors should keep in mind before paying too much that the average annual return for stock holdings long term is nine percent to ten percent a year a return of fifteen percent is considered praiseworthy
Paying say ten percent for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return

Coldwell Banker Commercial Group said it sold forty seven million dollars of common stock to its employees at ten dollars a share giving them a total stake of more than forty percent in the commercial real estate brokerage firm
Though the offering did n't sell out James J. Didion chairman and chief executive officer said We 're pretty proud of the employees ' response
They came up with their own money instead of borrowed money Mr. Didion said
It 's totally different
He said the offering was designed to create long term incentives for employees
We 're in a service business and in that context it 's vital to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success
The brokerage firm wo n't pay a dividend on the stock
Employees have the right to trade stock among themselves and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions
They may also eventually sell the shares to third parties but the outside investors who own the remaining sixty percent of Coldwell Banker have the right to first refusal
Bankers Trust and Sumitomo financed the three hundred million dollars acquisition from Sears Roebuck
Coldwell Banker also named three outside director nominees for its seventeen member board
The nominees are Gary Wilson chief financial officer of Walt Disney Company James Montgomery chief executive officer of Great Western Financial Corporation and Peter Ubberroth former commissioner of baseball and now a private investor
The first major event this morning in U. S. stock and futures trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc
That early morning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the nineteen eighty seven crash
The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume
Several of those post crash changes kicked in during Friday 's one hour collapse and worked as expected even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge
But the major circuit breakers have yet to be evaluated
A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test
A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other more sweeping changes proposed but not implemented after the last crash
Most notably several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force which analyzed the nineteen eighty seven crash would be revived especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary
The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross market questions such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets
But for the moment attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended
Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's five hundred contract as well as hot line communications among exchanges
During the first halt after the S. & P. index had fallen twelve points the Big Board 's Sidecar computer program automatically was triggered
That system is designed to separate computer generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks
One Merc broker compared the action in the S. & P. pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well drilled school
You do n't want the fire but you know what to do said Howard Dubnow an independent floor broker and a Merc governor
There was no panic
The system worked the way we devised it to work
After reopening for about fifteen minutes the S. & P. index tumbled to its thirty point limit and the second freeze went into effect
Traders then spent the last half hour watching to see if the Dow would drop two hundred fifty points Mr. Dubnow added referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour
One observer estimated that eighty percent to ninety percent of the S. & P. traders were just standing around watching
But the two hundred fifty point circuit breaker never had to kick in and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade 's Major Market Index also were n't triggered
The M. M. I. and the S. & P. five hundred are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies
The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the nineteen eighty seven crash
The process of post crash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments
In October nineteen eighty seven just after the market drop Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated
Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions
In addition limits were placed on computer driven trading and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets
Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated
At the outset the prime target was program trading which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill
There were also calls to strip the stock markets of derivative products such as stock index futures and options which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin for example likened to barnacles attached to the basic market
And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists or market makers
When the Brady Task Force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January nineteen eighty eight it immediately reshaped the reformers ' agenda
Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented
The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel the Working Group on the Financial Markets to review its analysis and those of other crash studies
In May nineteen eighty eight the Working Group made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve the Treasury the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission finally endorsed only circuit breakers
Privately some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists
After all this free market argument went the Dow only dropped more than two hundred fifty points once this century
Circuit breakers set to soften big drops
If S. & P. futures fall five points at opening contract trading pauses for ten minutes
If Dow Industrials fall twenty five points at opening contract trading pauses for ten minutes
If S. & P. futures fall twelve points equivalent to about one hundred points on D. J. I. A. trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher
On N. Y. S. E. program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders
If S. & P. futures fall thirty points trading is restricted for an hour to that price or higher
If Dow Industrials fall two hundred fifty points trading on the Big Board halts for an hour
S. & P. and M. M. I. contracts also halt
If D. J. I. A. drops four hundred points Big Board halts trading for two hours
Trading in M. M. I. and S. & P. futures also halted
Brady Task Force recommendations January nineteen eighty eight
Establish an overarching regulator for financial markets
Unify trade clearing systems
Make margins consistent across stock and futures markets
S. E. C. proposals May nineteen eighty eight
Require prompt reports of large securities trades
Give S. E. C. authority to monitor risk taking by affiliates of brokerage firms
Transfer jurisdiction over stock related futures to S. E. C. from C. F. T. C.
Opposed by new S. E. C. chairman
Give S. E. C. authority to halt securities trading also opposed by new S. E. C. chairman
Congressional proposal
Create a task force to review current state of the securities markets and securities laws
Breaking the Soviet government 's television monopoly an independent company has gained rights to show world programming including American films
There must not be a monopoly there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers Nikolai I. Lutsenko the president of the Nika T. V. company told the weekly newspaper Nedelya
The company is already working on its own programming in several provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a year the newspaper said
Mr. Lutsenko told Nedelya that he recently had been to the U. S. to pick up the rights to show five thousand U. S. films in the Soviet Union
Nedelya 's article was accompanied by a picture of Mr. Lutsenko interviewing singer John Denver in Colorado
Even though it will be independent of official television Nika will have an oversight board that will include members of the Communist youth league
South Africa 's National Union of Mineworkers said that about ten thousand diamond miners struck for higher wages at De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited
De Beers said that workers at five of the group 's mines were on strike which it said was peaceful with orderly picketing occurring at one of the mines

The World Wide Fund for Nature said that Spain Argentina Thailand and Indonesia were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders
A report by the conservation group presented at the U. N. sponsored Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Lausanne accused the four of trading protected species ranging from parakeets to orchids
Fund official Simon Lyster said world trade in wildlife was estimated to total five billion dollars of business annually

Small wonder that Britain 's Labor Party wants credit controls
A few hours after the party launched its own affinity credit card earlier this month the Tories raised the nation 's base interest rate
Labor 's Visa card is believed to be the first linked to a British political party
Labor gets twenty five pence thirty nine cents for every one hundred about one hundred fifty five dollars that a user charges to the card
As with other plastic in Britain 's high interest rate environment the Labor card administered by Co operative Bank carries a stiff in this case twenty nine point eight percent annual rate on the unpaid balance
China 's year long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets
The official China Daily said retail prices of non staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down
The State Statistical Bureau found that more than one billion yuan two hundred seventy million dollars was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies
The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to become very unreasonable and reduce needed funds for investment in the already difficult state budget
The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth which soared to twenty point seven percent last year to eight percent in nineteen ninety
Economists now predict the growth rate will be about eleven point five percent for the year

It all seemed innocent enough Last April one Steven B. Iken visited Justin Products Incorporated here identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company 's new cassette players for children
It is almost identical to the Sony product Mr. Iken remarked after seeing prototypes and pictures
Replied a Justin salesman Exactly
The Justin merchandise carried wholesale prices some forty percent below those of Sony Corporation of Japan 's My First Sony line
The visitor waxed enthusiastic and promised to return
But instead of a new customer part of a hoped for bonanza from underselling Sony Justin got a costly legal morass
Mr. Iken it turned out was a private detective using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for Sony
His recording later turned up as a court exhibit
Seeking to keep Justin 's My Own product line off the U. S. market Sony last May filed a suit in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement unfair competition and other violations of business law
Since then life has changed a lot for sixty one year old Leonard Kaye Justin 's owner
I have n't been able to get a decent night 's sleep since this has been going on he says
It 's the most distracting thing in my life I ca n't even attend to my business
His company annual sales about twenty five million dollars may suffer a costly blow losing an estimated ten percent of total sales if Sony annual sales about sixteen billion dollars prevails
Justin 's plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational
With considerable irony the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on U. S. business
Americans used to complain bitterly about being undersold by look alike products from Japan
Now Sony whose innovative premium priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics is bitterly complaining about a little U. S. firm with a cheap look alike produced in China
The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants to stop it says Lewis H. Eslinger Sony 's attorney who previously guarded Rubik 's Cube
Sony itself declines to comment
If Sony wins Mr. Eslinger says its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas
At worst he adds They 'd have to grind them all up and throw them away
Mr. Kaye denies the suit 's charges and says his only mistake was taking on Sony in the marketplace
I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper he says
Today U. S. Judge John E. Sprizzo is expected to rule on Sony 's renewed request for a pre trial order blocking sale of the disputed products on which deliveries began in July
The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order a decision upheld on appeal but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments
Though hoping to settle the case Justin vows to fight on if necessary
But the battle is more than Justin bargained for
I had no idea I was getting in so deep says Mr. Kaye who founded Justin in nineteen eighty two
Mr. Kaye had sold Capetronic Incorporated a Taiwan electronics maker and retired only to find he was bored
With Justin he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in Hong Kong beginning with Mickey Mouse radios
The company has grown to about forty employees from four initially Mr. Kaye says
Justin has been profitable since nineteen eighty six adds the official who shares his office with numerous teddy bears all samples from his line of plush toys
The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models
In court papers Sony says it has spent more than three million dollars to promote the line with resulting sales of over a million units
Sony found a new market niche but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower priced competitor
His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly resemble them in size shape and especially color
Sony uses mostly red and blue with traces of yellow and so does Justin on the theory that kids prefer these colors
To be successful a product can be any color whatsoever as long as it is fire engine red says Charles E. Baxley Justin 's attorney
By last winter Justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in Hong Kong and New York and Sony noticed
Indeed concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation such as withholding desirable Sony products against Justin 's customers Mr. Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April
He himself threatened to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or U. S. Justice Department
But Justin has n't pursued those charges which were without merit according to Mr. Eslinger the Sony attorney
Recalls Mr. Baxley Our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone
We never intended taking on Sony we do n't have the resources
Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit
Off and on since then the companies have skirmished in court
And Justin in a news release says Once competitive Sony now resorts to strong arm tactics in American courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets
Sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer are routine in such matters
He also insists that Sony no less than others has a legal right to protect its trade dress in this case mostly the colors that it claims make My First Sony products distinctive
Justin claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children 's market
Whatever its merits Sony 's aggressive defense is debilitating for Justin
It 's also costly
Mr. Kaye says he has paid more than seventy thousand dollars in legal fees so far
Of Sony Mr. Kaye says They know there 's no way for them to lose
They just keep digging me in deeper until I reach the point where I give up and go away
For now though he vows to hang in
@ Charles H. Tenney the Second chairman of Unitil Corporation purchased thirty four thousand six hundred two shares or four point nine percent of Unitil 's common according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
The stock was bought on Thursday in a privately negotiated transaction the filing said
As previously reported Unitil Exeter N. H. and Fitchburg Gas & Electric Company Fitchburg Massachusetts are targets of unsolicited tender offers from Boston based Eastern Utilities Associates

The investment bank becomes majority shareholder in Sports & Recreation a ten year old sporting goods retailer said Oliver E. Richardson a member of Investcorp 's management committee and a director of the chain
Sports Unlimited Tampa Florida posted revenue of fifty nine million dollars for the year ended July thirty first
The company is very profitable on an operating basis Mr. Richardson said but he declined to specify numbers
In nineteen eighty two Sports & Recreation 's managers and certain passive investors purchased the company from Brunswick Corporation of Skokie Ill
In the latest transaction management bought out the passive investors ' holding Mr. Richardson said
Hammond Company Newport Beach California said Fidelity National Financial Incorporated extended its previous agreement under which it wo n't purchase any more of the mortgage banker 's common stock through October thirty first
The previous agreement expired Thursday
Hammond said that its discussions with Fidelity an Irvine California title insurance underwriter are continuing but that prospects for a longer term standstill agreement are uncertain
Fidelity has increased its stake in Hammond to twenty three point five seven percent in recent months
Statements made in Securities and Exchange Commission filings led Hammond to request a standstill agreement
Giant Group Limited said it terminated negotiations for the purchase of Aspen Airways a Denver based regional carrier that operates the United Express connector service under contract to U. A. L. Corporation 's United Airlines
Giant a Beverly Hills California collection of companies that is controlled by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman did n't give a reason for halting its plan to acquire the airline and Aspen officials could n't be reached for comment
Giant agreed last month to purchase the carrier
Giant has n't ever disclosed the proposed price although Avmark Incorporated an Arlington Virginia based aircraft consulting concern has valued Aspen 's fleet at about forty six million dollars
The airline would have become the latest in a peculiar blend of Giant companies which are involved in making cement recycling newsprint and operating fast food restaurants
The state controlled insurer Assurances Generales de France said it has obtained regulatory approval to increase its stake in the financial holding company Company de Navigation Mixte above ten percent from the current level of about eight percent
Friday 's approval was needed to conform with Bourse rules regarding companies with bank interests and follows a similar approval given Wednesday to Cie Financiere de Paribas
Both Paribas and A. G. F. have been increasing their stakes in Navigation Mixte recently for what they have termed investment purposes although the issue has been surrounded by takeover speculation in recent weeks
An A. G. F. official did specify however that there was no foundation to recent rumors the group might be acting in concert with Paribas
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company a unit of Lockheed Corporation said it agreed to join with Aermacchi S.p A. of Varese Italy to propose a new generation of jet trainers for the U. S. Air Force
The Air Force is looking to buy five hundred forty new primary jet trainers with a total value of one point five billion dollars to two billion dollars between nineteen ninety four and two thousand four
The aircraft would replace the T. thirty seven made by the Cessna Aircraft Company unit of General Dynamics Corporation which the Air Force uses to train jet pilots
Lockheed said the U. S. Navy may also buy an additional three hundred forty trainer aircraft to replace its T. thirty four C. trainers made by the Beech Aircraft Corporation unit of Raytheon Corporation
Under the agreement with Lockheed Aermacchi will license Lockheed to build the Aermacchi M. B. three hundred thirty nine jet tandem trainer and will supply certain structures
Lockheed will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem seat trainer at its Marietta Georgia plant should the Air Force order the craft
A Lockheed spokesman in Burbank California said he was n't aware of which other companies would be competing for the Air Force contract
Striking auto workers ended their nineteen day occupation of a metal shop at a Peugeot S. A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital
But the Peugeot breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by Finance Ministry employees disrupted border checkpoints and threatened the government 's ability to pay its bills
The Peugeot metalworkers began filing out of the shop which makes auto parts at the plant in Mulhouse after voting five hundred eighty nine to one hundred ninety three to abandon the occupation
Their withdrawal was based on promises by Peugeot to open negotiations in Paris at the same time the last man left the premises
The strike by customs officers tax collectors treasury workers and other civil servants attached to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average Frenchman
Ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex job rating system they say fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise
The market for two hundred billion dollars of high risk junk bonds battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year practically vanished Friday
Trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds only to find themselves deserted by potential buyers
Stunned they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades
This calamity is far from over he says
Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the October nineteenth nineteen eighty seven crash
Simultaneously it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U. S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest quality securities they could find
But an eerie silence pervaded the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high yield bonds despite no active trading says John Lonski an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Incorporated
But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland the owner of the nationwide chain of seven eleven convenience stores that is strapped for cash
Goldman officials declined to comment
Junk bonds which mushroomed from less than two billion dollars at the start of this decade have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments
The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corporation which created its U. S. retailing empire with junk financing
Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department store chain up for sale
The music has stopped playing says Michael Harkins a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins
You 've either got a chair or you do n't
In Friday 's aftermath says R. Douglas Carleton a director of high yield finance at First Boston Corporation much of the seven billion dollars forward calendar could be deferred depending on the hysteria
In August First Boston withdrew a four hundred seventy five million dollars junk offering of Ohio Mattress bonds because potential buyers were very skittish
Indeed a Moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of twenty four high yield mutual funds declined for the seventeenth consecutive day Friday
The bond 's yield dropped to seven point eight two percent the lowest since March thirty first nineteen eighty seven according to Technical Data Global Markets Group
The yield on three month Treasury bills considered the safest of all investments plummeted about zero point seven percentage point to seven point one six percent the largest one day decline since nineteen eighty two
The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the one hundred ninety point five eight point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
When you get panic in one market you get flight to quality in the other said Maria Ramirez money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated
Nevertheless the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead
This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook says William Sullivan director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Incorporated New York
Any sustained credit easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities
Robert Dow a partner and portfolio manager at Lord Abbett & Company which manages four billion dollars of high yield bonds says he does n't think there is any fundamental economic rationale for the junk bond rout
It was herd instinct
He adds The junk market has witnessed some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets creamed that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk
I do n't believe that 's the case but I believe that people are running scared
There is a flight to quality and the quality is not in equities and not in junk it 's in Treasurys
Even as trading in high yield issues dried up over the past month corporations sold more than two billion dollars of new junk bonds
For example a recent three hundred seventy five million dollars offering of Petrolane Gas Services L. P. bonds sold by First Boston was three times oversubscribed
A five hundred fifty million dollars offering of Turner Broadcasting System Incorporated high yield securities sold last week by Drexel was increased fifty million dollars because of strong demand
First Boston estimates that in November and December alone junk bond investors will receive four point eight billion dollars of coupon interest payments
That 's a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on says Mr. Carleton of First Boston
When the rally comes insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will
There is plenty of money available from people who want to buy well structured deals it 's the stuff that 's financed on a shoestring that people are wary of
But such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have multiplied this year casting a pall over much of the junk market
Michael McNamara director of fixed income research at Kemper Financial Services says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer contributing to the slide in prices
Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals he says
This year at best it 's in one in every five or six
And our credit standards have n't changed one iota
However Mr. McNamara said the slide in junk is creating one hell of a buying opportunity for selective buyers
For the moment investors seem more preoccupied with the bad junk than the good junk
The market has been weak since the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York says Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch
That really affected the market in that people started to ask What else is in trouble
Well before Campeau though there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever
Despite the relatively strong economy junk bond prices did nothing except go down hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news
In June two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its one point two billion dollars of speculative debt securities New York based Integrated Resources Incorporated said it ran out of borrowed money
In July Southmark Corporation the Dallas based real estate and financial services company with about one point three billion dollars of junk bonds voluntarily filed for protection under U. S. bankruptcy law
By the end of July the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven year Treasury notes widened to more than five point five percentage points
In August Resorts International Incorporated which sold more than five hundred million dollars of junk bonds suspended interest payments
Meantime regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of abating
Moody 's says the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this year since nineteen eighty two
In addition there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of nineteen eighty one according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
The era of the nineteen eighties is about compound interest and the reaching for it says James Grant editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer an early critic of the junk bond market
What we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest
Businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings
What we 're seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy
Friday 's Market Activity
Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plummeting stock market
The benchmark thirty year Treasury bond was quoted six p. m. E. D. T. at one hundred three and twelve thirty seconds compared with one hundred and twenty seven thirty seconds Thursday up two and a half points
The yield on the benchmark fell to seven point eight two percent the lowest since March thirty first nineteen eighty seven according to Technical Data Global Markets Group
The flight to quality began late in the day and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market
Treasurys opened lower reacting negatively to news that the producer price index a measure of inflation on the wholesale level accelerated in September
Bond prices barely budged until midday
Prices of municipals investment grade corporates and mortgage backed bonds also rose but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts
Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association nine percent coupon securities the most liquid mortgage issue
The Ginnie Mae November ninth percent issue ended at ninety eight and twenty five thirty seconds up seven eighths point on the day to yield about nine point two eight percent to a twelve year average life assumption
Investment grade corporate bonds were up about a half to three quarters point
But the yield spread between lower quality investment grade issues and higher quality bonds widened
And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's three billion dollars bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority
Despite rumors that the T. V. A. 's long awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled
One of the sources said the smaller portions of seven hundred fifty million dollars each of five year and ten year bonds have already been substantially oversubscribed
Municipal bonds rose as much as three quarters point

Still the lesson is about the same On Friday the thirteenth the market was spooked by Washington
The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the U. A. L. takeover and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the U. A. L. trading halt
Still the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U. S. business
This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut
The real value of all shares after all is directly impacted by the tax on any profits all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not ordinary income
And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month
An hour before Friday 's plunge that provision was stripped from the tax bill leaving it with five point four billion dollars in tax increases without a capital gains cut
There is a great deal to be said to be sure for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill
It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one by one on their individual merits without trickery
For one thing no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up or down vote
Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens promises of a cleaner bill are suspect
Especially so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama fiasco
To the extent that the U. A. L. troubles contributed to the plunge they are another instance of Washington 's sticky fingers
As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course at some point the market will start to reject them
But the airlines are scarcely a clear case given anti takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner who professes to believe safety will be compromised if K. L. M. and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes
Worse Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon
It would give Mr. Skinner up to fifty days to review any bid for fifteen percent or more of the voting stock of any U. S. carrier with revenues of one billion dollars or more
So the U. A. L. deal has problems and the market loses one hundred ninety points
Congratulations Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman
In the nineteen eighty seven crash remember the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal to tax takeovers out of existance
Even more important in our view was the Treasury 's threat to thrash the dollar
The Treasury is doing the same thing today thankfully the dollar is not under nineteen eighty seven style pressure
Also traders are in better shape today than in nineteen eighty seven to survive selling binges
They are better capitalized
They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays
The Fed promises any needed liquidity
The Big Board 's liaison with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved it will be interesting to learn if circuit breakers prove to be a good idea
In any event some traders see stocks as underpriced today unlike nineteen eighty seven
There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in Washington
But on the bearish side that may be too much to expect
First Chicago Corporation posted a third quarter loss of twenty three point three million dollars after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans
The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago with forty eight billion dollars in assets said it set aside two hundred million dollars to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries
The addition on top of two big nineteen eighty seven additions to foreign loan reserves brings the reserve to a level equaling seventy nine percent of medium term and long term loans outstanding to troubled nations
First Chicago since nineteen eighty seven has reduced its loans to such nations to one point seven billion dollars from three billion dollars
Despite this loss First Chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital
During the quarter the company realized a pretax gain of sixty point four million dollars from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit
Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped twenty four percent against last year 's third quarter to thirty eight point two million dollars from fifty point five million dollars
Gains from First Chicago 's venture capital unit a big leveraged buy out investor rose thirty two percent to thirty four million dollars from twenty five point seven million dollars a year ago
Interest income and most fee income was strong

The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post electoral hagglings was in essence little more than the ill conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation On one side the center right New Democracy Party headed by Constantine Mitsotakis
On the other the so called Coalition of the Left and Progress a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro Communist cousin the Hellenic Left
The unifying bond for this left right mismatch was plain PASOK Mr. Papandreou 's party as common political enemy
The ostensible goal was a mop up of government corruption purportedly at all levels but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates
In point of fact this catharsis was overdue by decades
When reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges however the notion transmogrified into a promised assault with targets primarily for political gains not justice
Mr. Koskotas 's credibility is at best problematic
He has ample motive to shift the blame and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points
Nevertheless the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity
Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court
But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. Koskotas funneled into New Democracy coffers
In the end the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and indications that point to PASOK not clinching proof
On another issue Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency the E. Y. P. regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures including key opposition politicians journalists and PASOK cabinet members
Despite convincing arguments it was never established that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps
The central weakness of the scandals debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks
Naturally neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid or not to various Greek officials for services rendered
But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated
First came his predictable fusillade He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece
Then to buttress his credibility with the left he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner
Next he continued to court the communists many of whom feel betrayed by the left right coalition 's birth by bringing into PASOK a well respected Communist Party candidate
For balance and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis
Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal stench but also with seals of approval from representatives of its harshest accusers
Crucial as these elections are for Greece pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle
The country 's future NATO participation remains unsure for instance
Greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the nineteen ninety two targets of heightened Common Market cooperation
Greece 's bilateral relations with the U. S. need attention soon as well
For one the current accord concerning U. S. military bases in Greece lapses in May nineteen ninety
Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the June elections but the clock is running
Another matter of concern is the extradition of Mohammed Rashid a Palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the U. S. for the nineteen eighty two bombing of a Pan American Airways flight
The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case but the matter awaits final approval from Greece 's next justice minister
The Greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether Greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism
That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable the Greek press previously eager to palm off PASOK 's line has turned on Mr. Papandreou with a wild eyed vengeance
Yet the possibility of another lash up government is all too real
If Mr. Papandreou becomes the major opposition leader he could hamstring a conservative led coalition
Also he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March
New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles
As for Mr. Papandreou
He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage
But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who ever raked muck it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined but certainly not yet eliminated

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product 's flaws
The ruling stems from a nineteen eighty four suit filed by shareholders of Apple Computer Incorporated claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the Lisa computer introduced in nineteen eighty three
Lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the press defense by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling
According to the suit Apple officials created public excitement by touting Lisa as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year
The plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare the company circulated internal memos indicating problems with Lisa
The suit claimed Apple 's stock climbed to a high of sixty three dollars and fifty cents a share on the basis of the company 's optimistic forecasts
But when the company revealed Lisa 's poor sales late in nineteen eighty three the stock plummeted to a low of seventeen dollars and thirty seven cents a share according to the suit
The shareholders claimed more than one hundred fifty million dollars in losses
In nineteen eighty seven the San Francisco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the company 's statements by alerting consumers to Lisa 's problems
Late last month the appeals court agreed that most of the case should be dismissed
However it gave the shareholders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that pertains to Lisa 's disk drive known as Twiggy
The court ruled that the news media did n't reveal Twiggy 's problems at the time
Lawyers are worried about the ruling 's implication in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the court stressed that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the Apple case
The court is saying that the adverse facts have to be transferred to the market with equal intensity and credibility as the statements of corporate insiders
Shareholders ' attorneys at the New York firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie & Lerach last week petitioned for a rehearing of the case
They wrote The opinion establishes a new rule of immunity that if a wide variety of opinions on a company 's business are publicly reported the company can say anything without fear of securities liability
N. F. L. ORDERED to pay five point five million dollars in legal fees to defunct
The National Football League is considering appealing the ruling stemming from the U. S. Football League 's largely unsuccessful antitrust suit against the N. F. L.
A jury in nineteen eighty six agreed with the U. S. F. L. 's claims that the N. F. L. monopolized major league football
But the jury awarded the U. S. F. L. only one dollar in damages trebled because of the antitrust claims
Last week the U. S. Court of Appeals in New York upheld a five point five million dollars award of attorneys fees to the defunct league
Harvey D. Myerson of Myerson & Kuhn then of Finley Kumble Wagner Heine Underberg Manley Myerson & Casey was the lead trial lawyer and his new firm pursued the application appeal
Douglas R. Pappas of Myerson & Kuhn says about five point three million dollars of the award goes directly to the U. S. F. L. to reimburse it for fees already paid
Myerson & Kuhn will get about two hundred sixty thousand dollars for the costs of pressing the application
The federal appeals court held that the nominal damages and the failure to prove all claims did n't exclude the U. S. F. L. from being reimbursed
Antitrust laws provide that injured parties may be reimbursed for lawyers ' fees
But Shepard Goldfein an attorney for the N. F. L. says his client will consider asking for another hearing or appealing to the U. S. Supreme Court
The U. S. F. L. was not the prevailing party Mr. Goldfein insists
HOUSTON CALGARY ALLIANCE
Fulbright & Jaworski of Houston and Fenerty Robertson Fraser & Hatch of Calgary Alberta are affiliating to help serve their energy industry clients

But they will work together on energy environmental and fair trade related issues and conduct seminars on topics of mutual interest said Gibson Gayle Junior of five hundred eighty five lawyer Fulbright & Jaworski
In addition Fulbright & Jaworski 's Washington D. C. office will play a key role as the firms work together on regulatory issues particularly natural gas exports for their clients
IN WHAT MAY SIGNAL a turnaround for asbestos manufacturers W. R. Grace & Company won a three one two week trial in Pittsburgh over whether it should be required to remove asbestos fireproofing from a local high school
Mount Lebanon High School near Pittsburgh sought twenty one million dollars in compensatory damages from Grace arguing that the asbestos which can cause respiratory diseases and lung cancer posed a risk to students
Grace successfully contended that removing the fire retardant would pose a greater health risk than leaving it alone
A spokesman for the company said the verdict is thought to be the first in favor of an asbestos manufacturer where the plaintiff was a school and the asbestos in question was used for fireproofing

Roger Rosenblatt editor of U. S. News & World Report resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine
Mr. Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine 's editorial offices in Washington
Frankly I missed my family said Mr. Rosenblatt
In Mr. Rosenblatt 's tenure the magazine 's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly
Mortimer B. Zuckerman chairman and editor in chief said Mr. Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby the magazine 's executive editor and Merrill McLoughlin a senior writer

Mr. Zuckerman said his magazine would maintain its editorial format which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service oriented how to articles
Mr. Rosenblatt a senior writer at Time magazine before joining U. S. News & World Report said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor
The offers were to work as a writer not an editor
He said he will now consider those offers
The French aircraft group pointed out however that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently erratic because of irregular cash flow from large contracts
It noted for example that group revenue for the first half was eight point seven three four billion francs down about twelve percent from nine point nine three four billion francs a year earlier
Still it said it expects sales for all of nineteen eighty nine to be on the order of twenty billion francs reflecting anticipated billings for two large contracts in the second half of the year
For all of nineteen eighty eight Dassault had group profit of four hundred twenty eight million francs on revenue of eighteen point eight one nine billion francs
The group has n't yet released earnings figures for the first half of nineteen eighty nine nor has it made a detailed forecast of its full year earnings
After a tax benefit of about seven hundred eighty thousand dollars Keystone expects to report net income of two point three million dollars or about sixty two cents a share Mr. Simmons said
For third quarter last year Keystone reported a one million dollars loss from continuing operations and a two hundred thousand dollars loss from discontinued operations for a net loss of one point two million dollars
Revenue for the latest third quarter was about seventy point five million dollars up ten percent from sixty three point six million dollars last year he said
Mr. Simmons said the results signal a turnaround for the maker of wire and wire products which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of lower priced imported steel
Revenue for nineteen eighty nine is expected to be about three hundred million dollars up about twenty one percent from two hundred forty seven point three million dollars in nineteen eighty eight
Last year the company had a net loss of six point five million dollars including a six point one million dollars loss from continuing operations and a four hundred thousand dollars loss from discontinued operations
Revenue for the nine months is expected to be about two hundred thirty point five million dollars up about twenty one percent from one hundred ninety point four million dollars last year
Mr. Simmons said Keystone 's new mill is expected to produce about five hundred eighty five thousand tons of steel rods this year up from four hundred thirteen thousand tons in nineteen eighty eight
Keystone will have to consider expanding its casting operation at an estimated cost of eight million to ten million dollars within the next eighteen to twenty four months Mr. Simmons said
Prior to a year ago Keystone was an order taker
Now I think we have a group of marketing people who are out selling to retailers and wholesalers Mr. Simmons said
Still he said the one hundred year old company plans to continue its premium priced strategy for its distinctive brand of red tipped wire fencing and other products
The company claims a forty percent share of the U. S. field fence business a thirty five percent share of poultry netting sales and a thirty percent share of barbed wire sales
Freeport McMoRan Incorporated said a temporary cessation of operations at its Sunshine Bridge uranium recovery facility in Donaldsonville Louisiana will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its Freeport McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership unit
The company did n't elaborate
The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves
More than four hundred thousand pounds of uranium a year have been produced at the facility during the past seven years
A second uranium recovery plant at Uncle Sam Louisiana that produces more than seven hundred thousand pounds of uranium annually will continue to operate
Freeport McMoRan said the shutdown wo n't affect sales volumes under long term sales contracts of its Freeport Uranium Recovery Company unit but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market
Freeport McMoRan Resource Partners as owner of the uranium recovery technology receives royalty payments

Lomas Financial Corporation Dallas said it will ask a U. S. bankruptcy court to allow it to hire Lazard Freres & Company to help it sell its leasing unit
Lomas assisted by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets has been trying to sell its Equitable Lomas Leasing Company for several months apparently without success
The real estate and mortgage banking concern had hoped to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt
Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bank credit agreement Lomas defaulted on one hundred forty five million dollars in notes that became due September first
It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter eleven of the federal Bankruptcy Code September twenty fourth to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its one point four five billion dollars in senior debt
Lomas said Merrill Lynch which owns bonds and equity in Lomas could n't continue as Lomas 's investment banker because it is also a creditor
It said it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard 's offices in Europe and Japan where investors might be interested in a U. S. leasing company
It eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans he said
The bank said about five hundred twenty five million C dollars will be added to its existing L. D. C. and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter ending October thirty first
Mr. Bowder said the three hundred million C dollars charge to earnings would amount to about one dollar and thirty four cents a share
The bank 's net income for the nine months ended July thirty first was five hundred seventy seven million C dollars or three dollars and ten cents a share
Mr. Bowder said the bank will restructure its six hundred four million C dollars of Mexican debt of which two hundred fifty five million C dollars is in Mexican notes secured by U. S. government bonds
The bank has a forty five percent reserve against the remaining three hundred forty nine million C dollars of Mexican debt and expects to swap that for other Mexican notes supported by U. S. Treasury zero coupon bonds
He said the bank will no longer participate in L. D. C. sovereign lending but will support trade financing and other transactions that meet the bank 's standards
The carnage among takeover stocks Friday does n't mean the end of mega mergers but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game Wall Street 's big time deal makers say
Suitors from now on are more likely to be expansion minded companies rather than raiders or debt happy financiers
And they will be launching lower priced and perhaps fewer deals now that it 's tougher to finance them
This is an ominous sign for a stock market that lately has been fueled by takeover speculation and bidding wars for companies that put themselves up for sale
Whenever the nineteen eighties merger boom seems to be stalling shock waves ripple through the stock market
The market is overvalued not cheap says Alan Gaines of the New York money management firm Gaines Berland
He recently began increasing his cash position to forty five percent of his portfolio
I look at where deals can get done he says and they 're not getting done at current prices
Lenders are growing increasingly nervous about debt financed takeovers investment bankers say
Trading dried up Friday in the market for high yield junk bonds often used to finance takeovers
It was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market where prices began weakening last month after Campeau hit a cash crunch
And banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high risk takeover loans
The group trying to buy U. A. L. announced Friday that it could n't arrange the seven point two billion dollars in bank loans it needs to buy the parent of United Airlines for three hundred dollars a share
Takeover stock traders today will be scrambling to learn of any U. A. L. developments and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in sympathy
Investment bankers representing the buy out group and U. A. L. 's board spent a frantic weekend trying to hammer out new terms that would be more acceptable to the banks
After U. A. L. the stock viewed as most vulnerable is American Airlines ' parent A. M. R. the target of a one hundred twenty dollars a share takeover proposal from New York real estate developer Donald Trump
Trading in A. M. R. shares was suspended shortly after three p. m. E. D. T. Friday and did n't resume
Before the halt A. M. R. last traded at ninety eight and five eighths
Late Friday night the London office of Jefferies & Company a Los Angeles securities firm traded A. M. R. shares at prices as low as eighty
Similarly Delta Air Lines and U. S. Air Group dropped ten point one percent and eight point five percent respectively on Friday and could weaken further
Over the weeked however two developments in other deals indicated that commerical banks and Wall Street firms still are willing to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies
On Friday Anchor shares fell one and a quarter to close at eighteen and a half
Donaldson 's statement is n't merely an idle boast because those bonds will have to be sold before Donaldson 's bridge loan can be paid back
Security Pacific meanwhile said it expects to arrange four hundred thirty million dollars in bank loans for Vitro
On Friday LIN shares were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much dropping five and a half or four point nine percent to close at one hundred seven and a half
Traders and investment bankers said LIN shares were n't hurt much because BellSouth is viewed as a well financed corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers
Investment bankers interviewed over the weekend see a silver lining for the merger business in the stock market drop
Potential bidders for companies were saying that things were beginning to look expensive says Mr. Rattner of Lazard
Nothing makes things look cheaper than a two hundred point drop in the Dow Mr. Rattner says
Just as there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the stock market there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the deal market
Investment bankers expect most of those bargain hunters to be well heeled corporations
Now corporate buyers should be willing to re enter the acquisition market because the competition from junkbond financed buyers has been reduced
Many takeover stocks plunged Friday as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the socalled whisper stocks the targets of rumored deals
Columbia Pictures Entertainment which has agreed to a friendly twenty seven dollars a share bid from Sony of Japan fell only one eighth to close at twenty six and five eighths
But several stocks long rumored to be ripe for a takeover or restructuring fell ten percent or more
The market and investment bankers are even less sanguine about companies that have had at least one bid merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already
Given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market traders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again
Examples include Kollmorgen whose agreement to be acquired for twenty five dollars a share by Vernitron collapsed last month
Kollmorgen shares fell nearly twenty percent on Friday to close at twelve and seven eighths
Ramada which first delayed and then shelved a four hundred million dollars junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring fell fifteen point six percent to close at nine and a half
Ramada has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but has n't indicated when it will do so
But investment bankers say the market may have oversold some takeover related stocks
Hilton Hotels for example was among the worst hit issues falling twenty point two percent to close at eighty five down twenty one and a half on Friday
Hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses
People familiar with Hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sell off in Hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk bond financing
Hilton officials said they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock
William Lebo Hilton 's general counsel said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are on track for what has been described previously as a slow and deliberate process
I ca n't believe that any potential buyer for Hilton would be affected by one day 's trading Mr. Lebo said
But the stock market as a whole bolstered as it is by takeover speculation remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks
For debt ridden suitors the takeover game has been over for some time says New York money manager Neil Weisman of Chilmark Capital who has been keeping eighty five percent of his portfolio in cash
The market is just waking up to that point
Pauline Yoshihashi in Los Angeles contributed to this column
Of all the one time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease
To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment however the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms
It must also evaluate the real estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective
Specifically it must understand how real estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities
When a regional economy catches cold the local real estate market gets pneumonia
In other words real estate market indicators such as building permits and leasing activity plummet much further than a local economy in recession
This was seen in the late nineteen sixties in Los Angeles and the mid nineteen seventies in New York
But the reverse is also true When a region 's economy rebounds from a slowdown these real estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy
Why do local real estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles
Because real estate purchases and leases are such major long term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth
Metropolitan Detroit was written off economically during the early nineteen eighties as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment
Area employment dropped by thirteen percent from its nineteen seventy nine peak and retail sales were down fourteen percent
However the real estate market was hurt even more
For example residential building permits in the trough year of nineteen eighty two were off seventy six percent from the nineteen seventy nine peak level
Once metropolitan Detroit 's economy rallied in the mid nineteen eighties real estate rebounded
Building permits for example soared a staggering four hundred percent between nineteen eighty two and the peak year of nineteen eighty six
Where savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking are today 's opportunities
Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver two of the most depressed overbuilt and potentially undervalued real estate markets in the nation
Of course some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter cyclical play
But now appears to be the time to act
Metropolitan Houston 's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its nineteen eighty two peak
In the mid nineteen eighties employment was down as much as five percent from the nineteen eighty two peak and retail sales were off thirteen percent
The real estate market suffered even more severe setbacks
Office construction dropped ninety seven percent
The vacancy rate soared more than twenty percent in nearly every product category and more than thirty percent of office space was vacant
To some observers the empty office buildings of Houston 's see through skyline were indicative of a very troubled economy
As usual the real estate market had overreacted
Actually the region 's economy retained a firm foundation
Metropolitan Houston 's population has held steady over the past six years
And personal income after slumping in the mid nineteen eighties has returned to its nineteen eighty two level in real dollar terms
Today metropolitan Houston 's real estate market is poised for a significant turnaround
More than forty two thousand jobs were added in metro Houston last year primarily in biotechnology petrochemical processing and the computer industry
This growth puts Houston in the top five metro areas in the nation last year
And forecasts project a two point five percent to three percent growth rate in jobs over the next few years nearly twice the national average
Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real estate market has overreacted to the region 's economic trends although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston
By some measures metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years
Its population has continued to increase since nineteen eighty three the peak year of the economic cycle
Employment is now four percent higher than in nineteen eighty three
Buying income in real dollars actually increased fifteen percent between nineteen eighty three and nineteen eighty seven the most recent year available
The rates of increase however are less than the rapid growth of the boom years and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy
In a self fulfilling prophecy therefore the region 's real estate market all but collapsed in recent years
Housing building permits are down more than seventy five percent from their nineteen eighty three peaks
When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster such a recovery could occur as early as next year business and consumer confidence will return and the resulting explosion of real estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound
What real estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's
Generally overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid nineteen eighties peak even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington New York and Los Angeles
Vacancy rates in the fifteen percent to nineteen percent range today may easily rise to the low to mid twenty percent range in a couple of years
Under these conditions even a flattening out of economic growth catching cold in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia
Those looking for real estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short term three year lease and wait for the bargains ahead
Mr. Leinberger is managing partner of a real estate advisory firm based in Beverly Hills Calif
Kysor Industrial Corporation said it expects its third quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents a share compared with sixty one cents a share a year ago
Analysts had been projecting that the company 's earnings would be between twenty five cents and thirty cents a share
The year earlier third quarter earnings amounted to four point one million dollars
The company said a drop in activity in the powerboat industry reduced sales volume at its two marine related operations
Also the company said its commercial products operation failed to meet forecasts
Kysor a maker of heavy duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment said it expects its fourth quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels which are between thirty cents and fifty cents a share
Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate one million dollars in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U. S. senators who interceded with thrift industry regulators for him
Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a one point one billion dollars federal anti racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled Lincoln Savings & Loan Association and driving it into insolvency
I want to say in the most forceful way I can I certainly hope so
In a highly unusual meeting in Senator DeConcini 's office in April nineteen eighty seven the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln
According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was a ticking time bomb
Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous
The notes show that Senator DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's regulations grossly unfair and that Senator Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating 's thrift was viable and profitable
Lincoln 's parent company American Continental Corporation entered bankruptcy law proceedings this April thirteenth and regulators seized the thrift the next day
The newly formed Resolution Trust Corporation successor to the Bank Board filed suit against Mr. Keating and several others on September fifteenth
Mr. Keating has filed his own suit alleging that his property was taken illegally
The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln 's collapse has been estimated at as much as two point five billion dollars
Details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers
Senator DeConcini after months of fending off intense press criticism returned forty eight thousand dollars only last month shortly after the government formally accused Mr. Keating of defrauding Lincoln
Senator McCain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter fell between the cracks
Mr. Keating his family members and associates also donated one hundred twelve thousand dollars to Senator McCain 's congressional campaigns over the years according to press accounts
But Senator McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in nineteen eighty seven because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted
He became very angry at that left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp Senator McCain recalls
Also in July Ohio newspapers disclosed two hundred thousand dollars in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy a political committee controlled by Senator Glenn
That was in addition to thirty four thousand dollars in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator
Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright
Wilson Abney staff director of the ethics panel would n't comment
Senator Riegle said he would cooperate with any inquiry but that his conduct had been entirely proper
Senator McCain said he had been deeply concerned at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper but decided it was entirely appropriate for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent
Senator Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee
Senator DeConcini said When all is said and done I expect to be fully exonerated
Senator Cranston who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating portrayed his role in nineteen eighty seven as prodding regulators to act
Why did n't the Bank Board act sooner he said
That is what Common Cause should ask be investigated
Trinity Industries Incorporated said it reached a preliminary agreement to manufacture one thousand coal rail cars for Norfolk Southern Corporation
Trinity estimated the value of the pact at more than forty million dollars
Trinity said it plans to begin delivery of the rail cars in the first quarter of nineteen ninety
It said the one thousand rail cars are in addition to the one thousand four hundred fifty coal rail cars presently being produced for Norfolk Southern a Norfolk Virginia based railroad concern
When China opened its doors to foreign investors in nineteen seventy nine toy makers from Hong Kong were among the first to march in
Today with about seventy five percent of the companies ' products being made in China the chairman of the Hong Kong Toys Council Dennis Ting has suggested a new sourcing label Made in China by Hong Kong Companies
The toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the British colony
But in the wake of the shootings in Beijing on June fourth the Hong Kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on China
Although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by China 's political turmoil they are looking for additional sites
The toy makers and their foreign buyers cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies
Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket says David Yeh chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd
Indeed Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia especially in Thailand long before the massacre
Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China
By diversifying supply sources the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from China manufacturers and foreign buyers say
It would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade
A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's port airport banks and support industries such as printing companies have made China 's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site
South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world says Henry Hu executive director of Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd
Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border
In nineteen eighty eight exports of domestically produced toys and games fell nineteen percent from nineteen eighty seven to ten point oh five billion H. K. dollars one point two nine billion U. S. dollars
But re exports mainly from China jumped seventy five percent to fifteen point nine two billion H. K. dollars
In nineteen eighty nine 's first seven months domestic exports fell twenty nine percent to three point eight seven billion H. K. dollars while re exports rose fifty six percent to eleven point two eight billion H. K. dollars
Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern China where an estimated one hundred twenty thousand people are employed by the toy industry
In the meantime as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia
Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand including Matchbox Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Company the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. Ting
Malaysia the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied
With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in nineteen ninety two several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites
Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a nineteen eighty seven sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U. S. companies Worlds of Wonder Incorporated and Coleco Industries Incorporated
Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the nineteen eighty seven difficulties chastened the local industry causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management
The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results
Still they long for a mega hit toy to excite retail sales in the U. S. Hong Kong 's biggest market for toys and games
The closest thing the colony 's companies have to a U. S. mega hit this year is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of action figures manufactured by Playmates Holdings Ltd
Introduced in mid nineteen eighty eight the fifteen centimeter tall plastic turtles are based on an American comic book and television series
Paul Kwan managing director of Playmates says ten million Ninja Turtles have been sold placing the reptilian warriors among the ten biggest selling toys in the U. S.
Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season which accounts for about sixty percent of U. S. retail toy sales Mr. Kwan said the Ninja Turtles could make nineteen eighty nine a record sales year for Playmates
Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from nineteen eighty eight
Besides the lack of a fast selling product they cite the continued dominance of the U. S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System an expensive video game made by Nintendo Company of Japan
Nintendo buyers have little money left to spend on other products
Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before June fourth as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing 's austerity programs launched late last year
Toy makers complain that electricity in Guangdong has been provided only three days a week in recent months down from five days a week as the province 's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity
Manufacturers are upgrading standby power plants
Bank credit for China investments all but dried up following June fourth
Also concern exists that the harder line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong which has been the main laboratory for the open door policy and economic reforms
But toy manufacturers and other industrialists say Beijing will be restrained from tightening controls on export oriented southern China
They say China 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong
The Chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports says Mr. Kwan of Playmates
The Bush administration urging the Supreme Court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr argued that the nineteen seventy three Supreme Court decision Roe versus Wade recognizing a constitutional right to abortion was incorrect
He also argued that the high court was wrong in nineteen seventy six to rule that minors have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents
The administration 's position was outlined in a friend of the court brief filed in one of three abortion cases the Supreme Court will hear argued and will decide this term
The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion
The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions
Under that standard which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a reasonable justification for adopting it
That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since nineteen seventy three which requires a state to have a compelling reason for restricting abortion
The case Hodgson versus Minnesota will be argued November twenty ninth
The nation 's Number one aluminum maker earned two hundred twenty six point three million dollars or two dollars and fifty six cents a share a year earlier
Revenue rose eleven percent to two point eight three billion dollars from two point five six billion dollars
Analysts who were expecting Alcoa to post around two point seven zero to three dollars a share were surprised at the lackluster third quarter results
It 's disappointing said William Siedenburg an analyst with Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co
Lower prices for aluminum ingots and certain alloy products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings the company said
In addition costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant outages for modernization work the company said
Excluding the higher tax rate which rose two percentage points to thirty eight percent and the negative exchange rate adjustment the company would have met analysts ' expectations said R. Wayne Atwell an analyst with Goldman Sachs & Co
Noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry 's slowest Mr. Atwell added the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway
Nevertheless the company said shipments were up slightly to six hundred seventy nine thousand metric tons from six hundred seventy one thousand buffing the impact of the unexpected earning decline
The results were announced after the stock market closed
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday Alcoa closed at seventy two dollars a share down four dollars and seventy five cents in a sharply lower market
For twenty years federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest growing parts of the television business
And for six years N. B. C. A. B. C. and C. B. S. have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that
But with foreign companies snapping up U. S. movie studios the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever
Even network executives however admit privately that victory either in Congress or in talks with the studios is highly doubtful any time soon
And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the fin syn provisions known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules
N. B. C. 's interest may revive the deal which M. G. M. U. A. killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash
Even if that deal is n't revived N. B. C. hopes to find another
Our doors are open an N. B. C. spokesman says
N. B. C. may yet find a way to take a passive minority interest in a program maker without violating the rules
And any N. B. C. effort could prompt C. B. S. Incorporated and A. B. C. 's parent Capital Cities A. B. C. Incorporated to look for ways of skirting the fin syn regulations
But the networks ' push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios
Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin syn restraints
Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge
The networks still are uninhibited in their authority over what shows get on the air charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules
Studios are powerless to get shows in prime time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales he contends
And that 's why the rules for the most part must stay in place he says
Studio executives in on the talks including officials at Paramount Communications Incorporated Fries Entertainment Incorporated Warner Communications Incorporated and M. C. A. Incorporated declined to be interviewed
But Mr. Valenti who represents the studios asserts The whole production industry to a man is on the side of preserving the rules
Such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend
They do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate says one network executive
And there 's no indication that Washington is prepared to address the rules
That 's the problem is n't it
Indeed it is
Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess urging the studios and the networks which license rights to air shows made by the studios to work out their own compromise
But recent developments have made the networks and N. B. C. President Robert Wright in particular ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive
The latest provocation Sony Corporation 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Incorporated for three point four billion dollars and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Company for two hundred million dollars
In his article Mr. Holston who was in Europe last week and unavailable complained that the archaic restraints in fin syn rules have contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non U. S. enterprises
He did n't mention that N. B. C. in the meantime was hoping to assist Australia 's Qintex in buying
The Big Three 's drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former Time Incorporated went ahead with plans to acquire Warner
N. B. C. 's Mr. Wright led the way in decrying the networks ' inability to match a Time Warner combination
He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced
Since N. B. C. 's interest in the Qintex bid for M. G. M. U. A. was disclosed Mr. Wright has n't been available for comment
With a Qintex deal N. B. C. would move into uncharted territory possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington
It 's never really been tested says William Lilley the Third who as a top C. B. S. executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted
He now runs Policy Communications in Washington consulting to media companies
Fin syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca n't enjoy
Hence N. B. C. might be able to take say a five percent stake in a company such as M. G. M. U. A.
If the transaction raised objections the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake
But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication
Instead A. B. C. will have to sell off the rights for a one time fee
The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim for several years at the least
Six years ago they were tantalizingly close
The Reagan era Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules
But just eight days before the rules were to die former President Ronald Reagan a one time actor intervened on behalf of Hollywood
The F. C. C. effort collapsed
The networks and studios have bickered ever since
Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington but that seems unlikely
In Congress the issue falters It 's about money not program quality and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue
A spokesman for Representative Edward J. Markey D. Massachusetts who heads a subcommittee that oversees the F. C. C. says Mr. Markey feels the world has been forever changed by the Sony Columbia deal
But he said Mr. Markey hopes this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own
And at the F. C. C. meanwhile new Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has said he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan
Recognition Equipment Incorporated said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the U. S. Postal Service
The government sued the company in April seeking twenty three thousand dollars and other unspecified damages related to an alleged contract steering scheme
The suit named the company former chief executive officer William G. Moore Junior former vice president Robert W. Reedy and five defendants who were n't part of the company
The suit charged the defendants with causing Peter E. Voss an ex member of the Postal Service board of governors to accept twenty three thousand dollars in bribes kickbacks and gratuities
Mr. Voss was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined eleven thousand dollars for his role in the scheme
In the agreement Recognition agreed to pay the government twenty thousand dollars in return for the release of all claims against the company Mr. Moore and Mr. Reedy
The five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement
A trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began September twenty seventh in federal court for the District of Columbia
They were indicted last October on charges of fraud theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win four hundred million dollars in Postal Service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment
The company and its executives deny the charges
In a related development Recognition Equipment said the Postal Service has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional one hundred twenty days
The Postal Service originally suspended the company October seventh nineteen eighty eight and has been renewing the ban ever since
The company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension
Intel Corporation reported a fifty percent drop in third quarter net income partly because of a one time charge for discontinued operations
The big semiconductor and computer maker said it had net of seventy two million dollars or thirty eight cents down fifty percent from one hundred forty two point seven million dollars or seventy eight cents a share
The lower net included a charge of thirty five million dollars equal to twelve cents a share on an after tax basis for the cost of abandoning a computer systems joint venture with Siemens A. G. of West Germany
Earning also fell from the year ago period because of slowing microchip demand
Sales amounted to seven hundred seventy one point four million dollars down one point seven percent from seven hundred eighty four point nine million dollars
But Intel later succumbed to the stock market 's plunge closing at thirty one dollars and seventy five cents down two point one two five dollars
On Friday Andrew S.Grove Intel president and chief executive officer said Intel 's business is strong
Our bookings improved as the quarter progressed and September was especially good
For the full quarter our bookings were higher than the previous quarter and our book to bill ratio exceeded one point oh
Revenue amounted to two point two three billion dollars up slightly from two point one five billion dollars
Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday
After twenty six years in prison Mr. Sisulu the seventy seven year old former secretary general of the liberation movement was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up
At the same time six A. N. C. colleagues five of whom were arrested with him in nineteen sixty three and sentenced to life imprisonment were reunited with their families at various places around the country
I am happy to see the spirit of the people said Mr. Sisulu looking dapper in a new gray suit
As the crowd outside his home shouted A. N. C. A. N. C. the old man shot his fists into the air
I 'm inspired by the mood of the people
Under the laws of the land the A. N. C. remains an illegal organization and its headquarters are still in Lusaka Zambia
But the unconditional release of the seven leaders who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the A. N. C. is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing
The government can never put the A. N. C. back into the bottle again said Cassim Saloojee a veteran anti apartheid activist on hand to welcome Mr. Sisulu
Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now
There 's no turning back
And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela the A. N. C. 's leading figure who was jailed with them and remains in prison
Without him said Mr. Sisulu the freeing of the others is only a half measure
But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country
As other repressive governments particularly Poland and the Soviet Union have recently discovered initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult if not impossible to control
If it does n't yield on these matters and eventually begin talking directly to the A. N. C. the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest
If it does the large number of right wing whites who oppose any concessions to the black majority will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands
The newly released A. N. C. leaders also will be under enormous pressure
The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti government protests and violence if it does Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars
Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government
In order to head off any divisions Mr. Mandela in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released instructed them to report to the A. N. C. headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible
The men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many militant black youths the so called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action
Says Peter Mokaba president of the South African Youth Congress We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the A. N. C.
They never considered themselves to be anything else
At last night 's rally they called on their followers to be firm yet disciplined in their opposition to apartheid
We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very very sensitive said Andrew Mlangeni another early Umkhonto leader who is now sixty three
We want to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us
